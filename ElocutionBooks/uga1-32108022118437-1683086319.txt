The first of the following notices, is from the pen of N. R. SMITH, A. M., one of tho
greatest inasters of Elocution now living: the second is from Mr. Kent, an able pro.
fessor in the University of Upper Canada.
Mr. Samuel Kirkhani of Baitimore, known to many of our citizens as the author of
a popular English Grammar, has publisherl "An Essay on Elocution, designed for the
use of schools and private learners.” After a careful perusal of this work, I am de.
cidedly of opinion, that it is the only successful attempt of the kind. The rules are
copious, and the author's explanations and illustrations are happily adapted to the
comprehension of learners. No school shonld be without this book, and it ought to
find a place in the library of every genileman who values the attainment of a just
and forcible elocution.
Pittsburg Mercury, April 18, 1834.
The Essay now before us, needs not depend on any former work ofits author for a
borrowed reputation: it has intrinsick merits of its own. It lays down principles
clearly and concisely. Ii presents the reader with many new and judicious selections.
both in prose and poetry; and allogether evinces great industry, combined with taste
and ingenuity.
Courier of Upper Canada, York, Oct. 12, 1833.
Of the talent and judgment of Mr. Kirkham, we have already had occasion to speak
in terms of honest praise. His work on Elocution raises him still higher in our esti
mation, for we find it (and we have rused it attentively, and with the utinost pleasure)
one highly calculated to mend the inanners, and correct the taste, of a certain barbar.
ous class of readers and declaiiners that, at present, inſest alınost every rank in so.
cie:y. Besides this, the book would be of great utility in schools-such a one as has
long been wanted; and we are glad to see it forthcoming. In his selections, th3
author has displayed his usual tact and ability. It abounds in beautiful extracts, and
judicious illustrations and remarks.
Baltimore Visiter, July, 1833.
We think Mr. Kirkham's Elocution worthy of publick patronage, and, have no doubt
that, were it introduced into our academies, it would be found a most valuable book,
both to the teacher and pupil. The familiar and forcible style of Mr. Kirkham, so
justly adinired in his work on Grammar, is fully preserved in his work before us.
Eastern Shore Whig, March 18, 1834.
Mr. Kirkham has performed a very acceptable service to teachers, by presenting
them wuh this “Essay." The selections are remarkably judicious; the arrangement,
good; the rules, siinple and perspicuous. National Intelligencer, July 7, 1834.
No part of education, equally important, is so generally neglected as Elocution;
and this neglect arises principally from the want of some suitable book on the subject.
In my opinion, Mr. Kirkham's Essay is a work every way calculated to supply this
want, and is far better adapted to the use of schools and private learners, than any
other systein with which I am acquainted.
S. CAVERNO,
Lewistown Academy, N. Y. Oct. 7, 1833.
Mr. B. F. Winchester :-Sir, I have examined the Essay on Elocution" by Samuel
Kirkhain.-It clearly explains and illustrates the principles of the science, and, with
diligence on the part of the student, cannot fail to answer the end designed. I could
wish that the last chapter of pari first, might be read by every clergyman in the
world.
Respectfully, yours, (Rev.) s. G. WINCHESTER.
Philadelphia, July 22, 1834.
Mr. Kirkham: Dear Sir, In the course of thirty years' experience in teaching Eng.
lish Grammar and Reading in this city, no event of the kind has so highly gratified me,
as the opportunity you have afforded me of examining your English Grammar and
treatise on Llocution. I most heartily acknowledge, that, upon a careful and thorough
perusal of them, I find that every facility which I have so often needed, but never.
before found, is exactly furnished ;-principles are clearly and concisely laid down,
and very happily adapted to the comprehension of the learner. Thoroughly con
vinced of their utility, I shall lose no time in introducing them both into my school.

PREFACE.
A PREFACE is to the reader, what a fence is to a horse, when it ob
structs his progress to a field of sprouting herbage, which he considers
himself jus:ifiable to enter by leaping over the barrier. The reader
wades through a long preface with as much reluctance, as he would
pass through the ordeal of a ceremonious introduction to a large assem-
blage of guests, when invited to dine with a stranger. This repugnance
to preface-reading, doub:less, arises out of the fact, that prefaces are gen-
erally dull, and often but the prelude to a still duller book.
To the author, a preface is considered as privileged ground. Upon
this arena, hc deems hinself at liberty to act without restraint-to tyr-
annise over the time and patience of his reacler, by giving a loose rein
to his fancy, and by pursuing a course as wayward and foreign to the
subject before him as either his pedantry or his vanity may dictate. In
the after pages of his work, he considers himself under obligation occa-
sionally to cast a sidelong glance at the subject he is professing to dis-
cuss, and to pay so ne little respect to the laws of unity, and to a system-
atick arrangement of his thoughts. We cannot, therefore, but ailmire
this bountiful provision secured to him by the power of cusiom, by which
provision he is allowed, afier having toiled through the tedious task of
manufacturing a ponderous volume, here to throw off the shackles, and
revel over this licensed corner of his field, and become as familiar, and
egotistical, and inane, as his conscience and common sense will permit.
But it might be well for some writers (myself included, undoubtedly)
to consider that custom is a fickle dame, and that reason is not always
found in alliance with her.
On this subject, however, custom has not been so parsimonious as to
confine her liberality exclusively to the author. If she has granted him
the privilege of being dull and prolix in his preface, she has as
obligingly favoured the reader with the privilege of escaping from his
prefatory dulness and prolixity, by skipping over them, and by com-
mencing at the proper beginning of his book. And now, with becoming
candour, 1 announce to my very gentle reader, that if he begins to grow
weary of my own prosing, I shall not deem it unkind or uncourteous in
him, should he avail himself of his privilege by breaking off at the close
of this sentence, and by turning over to the pages which follow this my
prelusive disemboguement; for, on the score of prolixity, I do not hold
myself bound, under cover of my privilege, to show him any merey. I
have on hand a bundle of disorderly and incoherent ideas, which are
quite clamorous to be released from bondage; and being very conscien-
tious, and compassionate withal, I seldom have the hardihood to turn a
deaf ear to the cries of the distressed. It is, therefore, altogether for the
purpose of fulfilling a moral duty, that I give these fugitives their free-
dom, and allot them a place in this, the most suitable, part of my work.
Prefaces generally open with a stupid apology for the sin of boring the
publick with another book. But a book should be its own and its only
apologist. If it is well written, and its subject is important, needs no
apology; but if the reverse-if its manufacturer has arrogated to him-
self the dignity and responsibility of authorship, without considering

:
whether he is able to manage his subject in a more masterly manner
than his predecessors have done, or even if he has deceived himself in
his estimate of his own abilities, an apology, so far from shielding him
from rebuke for his daring perpetrations with pen and ink, will but serve
as so much dead weight to sink still lower his drowning cause.
An apology is generally deemed a mark of modesty in an author; but
whether he render in this token of diffidence as an atonement for the
transgression of thrusting himself between his predecessors and the pub-
lick, or whether he boldly assert his superiority over them, is of little
moment; for, hy the very act of writing and publishing, he assumes such
superiority
Of all the “labours done under the sun," the labours of the pen meet
with the poorest reward. Even in this age of much light and more
reading, an author is often compelled to live on short allowance, and
trudge on foot, whilst his more fortunate bookseller revels in luxury,
and rolls along in his coach. An ignorant fellow may easily grow rich
by selling almanacks, tape, toys, turnips, and teakettles, where a talented
author would starve.
Writers of dull books, however, if patronised at all, are rewarded be.
yond their deserts. We are under no obligation to sympathize with
those authors who have “passed their nights without sleep, in order to
procure it for their readers." Thecumbrous labours of such men prove
unavailing, from an apparently trifling difference of opinion between
them and the world which they attempt to enlighten. With an honest
zeal they maintain, that their produciions are brilliant, but the world
perversely denounces them as execrable: and thus, merely by being
outvoted, their ponderous tomes soon lumber down into the tomb of for-
getfulness. As in raising grain, the quantity of sound wheat is dimin-
ished by a rank growth of the straw, so, in the production of books,
the amount of solid information they contain, seems to decrease in pro-
portion to the ſecundity of the crop.
By reflecting upon the pains and penalties of book-making, and the
deplorable fate which awaits the vast majority of those who join the
craft, one might naturally conclude, that the experiment of authorship
has become so hazardous as to deter fresh adventurers from entering
the field ; but such a conclusion is so far from being justified by facts,
that it would seem as if the number of authors were increased in a
ratio corresponding with the increase of the difficulties and dangers
which beset their path. Indeed, in modern times, authorship has be-
come a mania, or, perhaps I should say, an epidemick, which appears to
be infectious, and which ihreatens to inundate our land, and leave it en-
cumbered with sand and rubbish.
To the no small annoyance of the community, this alarming malady
has particularly affected the honourable fraternity of teachers; and
thereby plungeil many a thriving family into deep-mystification and
doubt. When one of them happens to blunder on to the track of a
straggling idea that he deems unique, or to get hold of a foolish conceit,
or a new-ſangled notion, every intellectual current in his cranium runs
riot, and gives him no rest, until he has it written out and printed.
Hence, the onerous amount of maudlin abortions in the shape of school-
books which is annually disgorged from the press. Without once taking
into consideration the enormous difference between carping at the defi-
ciencies, and condemning the faults, of others, and that of avoiding
faults and supplying deficiencies, and, losing sight, also, of the important
truism, that knowledge derived from experience, in order to subserve

any useful purpose either in authorship, or in its application to business,
must be drawn from successful experience, many of these book-mongers
seem to take it for granted, that, to be able to raise plausible objections
to the books that have fallen in their way, and to profess experience in
teaching a particular science, constitute the grand climacterick of all that
is requisite in order to form a successful writer upon that science. But
it is not the man who has merely taught, or who has taught long, or who
is able to point out defects in authors, that is capable of cnlightening the
world in the respective sciences which have engaged his attention ; þut
the man who has taught well. It is the man of genius and enterprise,
he who has brought to the task of his calling uncommon powers of dis-
crimination and a sound judgment, and whose ambition has led him,
not to rest satisfied with following the tedious routine of his predeces-
sors, but to strike out a new and a better track, or, at least, to render
smoother and brighter the path long trodden. It is to such men, and
such only, that we are indebted for all our great improvements in the
construction of elementary works for schools and private learners.
Book-makers are too often like office-seekers, who first procure the
place, and then bethink themselves of the qualifications necessary to the
discharge of its duties. They too frequently set down merely to make a
book, without considering, either the importance of the undertaking, or
- whether they possess the qualifications requisite for its successful ac-
complishment. But the course pursued by such writers, is as evidently
inverted as that which would induce one to read a discourse backwards,
or to commence a speech with the peroration, and close it with the ex-
ordium, or to attempt to discover the sources of the Nile, by strolling
down the banks of the Scamander. There is not, perhaps, a more preva-
lent and mischievous errour than that which supposes the writers of bad
books to be an invocent set of beings, who do litle or no harm, unless,
indeed, it is that which imagines that the authors of good books, are gen.
erally rewarded according to their merit. Bad books are like bad
medicines, which, when they do no good, are sure to produce ill effects.
If bad books were entirely neutral, they would, of course, have no evil
tendency; but the misfortune is, they are much read, and lead their un-
fortunate voiaries into errour. One who is pursuing the path of errour, is
certainly farther from truth than he was before he set out, for it leads
directly from her temple; and before he can enter this temple, he has
to retrace his steps.
But does not the publick always discriminate between merit and de-
merit, and distribute its rewards accordingly ? Far from it. The publick
is, indeed, a potent umpire, and one that opens a liberal purse to its fa-
vourites; but to its greatest benefactors, it generally proves a heartless
tyrant, by taking care, that they shall first be duly starved to death, and
then handed over to posterity for their rewards, which come in the
shape of monuments, reared to perpetuate their memories.
The truth is, the general mass are not proper judges of books. Hence,
their liability to be deceived. How often are they robbed of their time,
by poring over pages of trifling, inane, and uninstructive matter—to the
perversion of their taste, and the debasement of their minds—when this
mispent time, were it devoted to the perusal of works filled with sound
sense and solid instruction, would afford them an intellectual banquet
from which they might arise with minds refreshed and richly stored
with that wisdom which adorns and dignifies human nature, elevates
man to his proper rank in the scale of being, and qualifies him to fulfil,
with honour and usefulness, his various offices in life.

PREFACE.
But school-books, more especially, as they fall into the hands of chil-
dren and youth-of such as peculiarly need lights to guide them, and
encouragements to excite them, when defective or erroneous, are more
pernicious than any others; for they prove either false gaides, which
lead their readers astray, or no guides, which leave them in darkness.
Hence, such books are worse than no books. What, then, is to be
done, in order to avert the evil influence of bad books-an evil which
has been rapidly increasing ever since Cadmus had the kindness to in-
vent letters? If this evil cannot be remedied, surely it may be easily
retarded in its progress. Let parents, and guardians, and publick func-
tionaries, at once set themselves at work to elevate the profession of
school-kecping to the rank and dignity of the other, less important, learned
professions, by increasing the salaries of instructers, so much as to enlist
in this noble calling, none but men of genuine talents and truly liberal
acquirements, and, not only will bad books soon hide their diminished
heads, but the youth of our country will receive twice as good an edu-
cation as they now do, at less expense, because, in a far shorter time.
When we reflect upon the mighty infuence which early impressions
have over the minds and conduct of men, the importance of putting good
books into the hands of the young, as well as, of giving them proper,
oral instructions, presents itself with increased magnitude. Erroürs im-
bibed in early life, are seldom rooted out in riper years.
As a mere
pebble may turn the course of a stream at the fountain-head, so, a vir-
tuous hint, or a poisonous errour, instilled into the mind of a youth, may
not only influence his career through this life, by directing him into the
path of honour and usefulness, or by leading him into the road of infamy
and disgrace, but its influence may extend to his well or ill being through
the endless ages of eternity.
It may be justly said, that teachers and authors, in no small degree,
preside over ihe destinies of a free people. According to the bias which
They give to the minds of those who receive instructions from them,
they either exalt or lower the dignity of a nation. How high a meed
of praise, then, does he merit, whose labours are successful in improving
our systems of learning in such a manner as to give a new impetus to
the intellectual energies of the rising generation! The seeds of knowl-
edge which he sows, will be continually springing up in a more and
more genial soil, as generation succeeds generation, and will produce
more and more abundantly those luxuriant germes of liberty and science
which adorn, and beautify, and polish, and exalt a free people. The
benefits of his labours will shine forth with increasing lustre through
those brilliant geniuses who will hereafter arise and pour fresh floods
of light into the moral world—streams that will blaze along the track
of time, bearing light and glory down to the remotest posterily.
When we take into consideration the vast and growing resources of
our country, and associate them with the intellectual advancement she
has already made, it may not be altogether forlorn to hope, nor chimer-
ical to suppose, that the day is not remote in which the attention of our
statesmen and publick functionaries generally, will be more singly direct-
ed to the all-important object of raising our literary character to a far
loftier height than has hitherto been attained by any nation. In such a
day of prosperity as this, when it has become a moot point of national
legislation how to dispose of surplus revenue-when the highest honours
and rewards await the man of genius and scientifick enterprise, what
but the want of enlightened views and liberal measures can prevent lit-
erary, and scientifick, and political, and religious knowledge, from soon

dowing through our land in channels broad and deep-knowledge, pure
as the mountain rill, abundant as the waters of the ocean? What but
The want of such views and such measures, can prevent this republick
from soon raising a literary, as well as a political, standard, that shall
wave as a proud beacon to all the nations of the earth? I must confess
my unwillingness to abandon the hope, that to us such a day of national
prosperity and literary pre-eminence is rapidly rolling on-a day in which
our statesmen will become far more enlightened and liberalized; when
talented authors will be more substantially encouraged; the profession of
teaching, elevated; and bad books, discarded ; when our national dig-
nity, rising in its literary greatness, will shed an undying halo of glory
around our political horizon ; when our publick institutions will extenů
their civilizing, and humanizing, and christianizing influence over
every island, sea, and mountain, and penetrate the remotest corners of
the earth—a day in which Europe, Asia, and Africa, will thankfully
look up to her for light and direciion, and be proud to imitate her noble
example--an era of literary redemption, and the advent of science, in
which national prejudices will be overthrown, national animosities,
trampled down, national restrictions, rescinded, and the sons of science
rise up in every republick, and kingdom, and country, and hold commun-
ion at the fountain of Apollo-in short, a literary millennium, in which
ibe Alps will salute the Alleganies, the Himalayas will make obeisance
to the Andes, the Niger, the Volga, the Ganges, and the Nile, will
claim kindred with the Columbia, the Mississippi, and the Colorado,
and the waters of the Caspian and of the Superiour, will rise up and em-
brace each other.
Courteous reader, lest, by this time, you may think me inclined to be
garrulous, if not flighty, upon topicks quite foreign to the subject before
me, I will now put a bridle upon my wayward thoughts, and lead them
directly into the channel marked out for preface-makers by the good old
rules of criticism. Possibly the following pages will justify the conclu-
sion, that the author of them does not possess the qualifications which
he has prescribed as indispensable to the successful writer; and that,
whilst he deals out his censures to others with an unsparing hand, he is
himself guilty of greater faults than those he condemns. Every one knows
how much easier it is to point out faults, than to produce original er-
cellences. But whatever may be the defects of the work now merging
into being, as author and compiler of it, I have one strong consolation,
which is, that its utility will not depend alone on the efforts of my own
talents. If the pages penned by myself, present little that is new and use-
ful, a redeeming virtue may be claimed, by presenting in those which
follow, much that has been long tried in the crucible of criticism, and
which, like pure gold, has been found always to grow brighter by the
process of refining.
It may not be allogether inappropriate, in passing, for me to explain
the grounds on which is based the presumption of my coming forward
to enrol my humble name upon the list of authors on Elocution. It is
well known, that, but a few years ago, the tide of grammatical science,
as it pertains to the English language, was at a very low ebb in our
country, as well as in Great Britain. What the efforts of a few in-
dividuals have since done to swell this tide, and conduct it into the
humblest walks of life, is equally known. Among those who have sue-
cesstully laboured in the philological field, Mr. Lindley Murray stands
forth in bold relief, undeniably at the head of the list. That the writer's
own labours in the same field, have also contributed, in some degree, to

effect that great revolution which has recently taken place with regard
to the cultivation of grammatical science, and which so highly redounds
to the honour and glory of the age in which we live, he is proud to be-
lieve. Since the days of Lowth, no other work on grammar, Mur-
ray's excepted, has been so favourably received by the publick as his
As one proof of this he would mention, that within the last six years,
it has passed through fifty editions.* By its unfolding, and explaining,
and applying the principles of grammar, it has brought this hitherto
abstruse science within the reach of the humblest capacity, and thereby
encouraged thousands, and tens of thousands, to acquire a knowledge
of this important branch of learning, who, otherwise, would have passed
it by with neglect.
In the interiour of Pennsylvania and the State of New York, in the
Western States, in the lower regions of the Mississippi valley, and in
many other sections of our country into which the author's work has
penetrated, and become the general text-book in grammar, the number
of those who are now successfully cultivating a knowledge of this
science, is nearly or quite luice as great as it was before his treatise
was introduced; and in many neighbourhoods, it has more than quadru-
pled. This flattering success, then, of his first essay in authorship, has
encouraged biin to adventure upon another branch of science which,
for some years past, has particularly engaged his attention. That he is
capable of doing ample justice to his present subject, he has not the
vanity to imagine; but it his knowledge drawn from observation, and
experience in teaching elocution, enable him so to treat the science as
to call the attention of some to its cultivation, and induce others more
capable than himself to write upon it, he will thereby contribute his
mite towards rescuing from neglect a branch of learning which, in its
important bearings upon the prosperity of the free citizens of this great
republick, stands second to none: and thus, in the consciousness of having
rendered a new service to his country, he will secure the reward of his
highest ambition. Should this first edition be at all greeted by the
friends of science, he will endeavour to improve his work, and ultimately
send it forth with less imperfections resting upon its head.
Some may think, that, in a few instances, the author has taken an
undue liberty with the style of the writers whose labours he has appro-
priated. But when it is considered, that this work is designed chiefly
to be read in schools, where grammatical improprieties would be ex-
tremely injurious to the germinating taste of the young reader, it will
doubtless be conceded, that the sacrilege of disturbing the monuments
of the dead—the profanation of removing a little of the rust and rubbish
which adhere to the precious gems of an antiquated, or even of a modern,
author, is, on the whole, a lighter transgression than either to neglect to
furnish the rich banquet, or to get it up in a slovenly manner.
The scientifick portion of this mannal, is far more defective than it
would have been, had not the author, since making arrangements for
publishing it, been prevented, by unfavourable, unforeseen, and uncontrol-
lable circumstances, from devoting half that time and attention to its
composition and arrangement, which even a tolerable degree of excel-
lence in execution, required.' His highest aim has been to treat the
subject briefly and practically; and thereby to render his work useful
to such as have but little leisure to devote to this science.
* It has now (1835) passed through orer one hundred and troenty editione.

In the selected part, he has endeavoured to present such pieces as are
calculated to cultivate the taste, enlighten the understanding, improve
the judgment, and establish the morals of the young, and, at the same
time, to inspire them with a fondness for reading, and a desire to excel
in the science of elocution.
In conclusion, it affords the author no small degree of pleasure to ac-
knowledge the obligation he is under to Dr. James Rush, who, with a
liberality peculiar to superiour minds, and a courtesy exercised only by
accomplished men, tendered to the author, in the compilation and ar-
rangement of his work, such a use of his own, admirable treatise on the
Philosophy of the Human Voice," as he might think proper to make.
This remark will sufficiently explain to the reader, the grounds of that
license by which the author has drawn so many of his best materials
from the rich depository alluded to.*

MANKIND are more frequently swayed by, prejudice than reason.
Reason has a clear eye; but prejudice is blind, and either clings tena.
ciously to old doctrines and time-worn systems, or gropes forward in im-
minent danger of stumbling upon the dark mountains, of errour. Hence,
new systems generally meet with more opposers than advocates; and
hence, too, bad systems and false doctrines, on their first promulgation,
gain as many proselytes as those that are genuine and useful. We
need not wonder, then, that philosophers have been imprisoned, states-
men banished, poets starved, apostles beheaded, and that the Saviour
of men was crucified, while dupes and impostors have been counte.
nanced, honoured, and even deified. Nor need we be astonished that
every successful improvement in science and the arts, has gained its
popularity only by slow degrees. That reformer, therefore, who would
succeed, must not attempt, at once, any great innovation. It is in ac-
cordance with this maxim, that I have undertaken to do but a liltle in
the following Essay.
They who have long groped in the darkness of a dungeon, cannot
bear to be suddenly ushered into the full glare of a noonday's sun.
How can it be expected, then, that those who have hitherto been con-
tent to read, or rather, try to read, without a knowledge of any of the
principles of reading, can be persuaded to adopt, at once, all the princi
ples of the science? Believing it better to do a little good, than no good,
I have contented myself, for the present, with presenting to the publick,
only those principles of clocution that I deem most important in practice,

ADVERTISEMENT TO THE THIRD EDITION.
to give a more extensive and complete treatise upon the subject. To a
man who is wandering in the dark, a farthing candle is betier than to
light.
Inattention to principles in our systems of instruction, has long been
complained of by the discerning few; and, although some slighi refor-
mation in regard to this point, has taken place in our schools, yet the
great importance of it, is still, both by teachers and parents, too gener-
ally overlooked. That the examination and investigation of princi.
ples, in any art or science, are highly calculated to call into active ex:
ercise the reasoning faculties, is universally admitted. How incon-
sistent is it, then, to ihink of ieaching children to read, without causing
them to pay attention to the principles of reading !-li is hoped that so
gross an absurdity as this, will not much longer disgrace our schools
and seminaries of learning.
The investigation and afplication of the principles of elocution, as
well as the study of the principles of grammar, arithmetick, philosophy,
phrenology, and so forth, tend not only to develop and expand the in-
tellectual powers, but, also, in a pre-eminent degree, to cultivate tlie
taste, and refine the mind.
We boast of our liberal institutions, and of our admirable form of
government: nay, more; of our intelligence. It is admilted that we
have done much for the cause of learning; but who cannot perceive,
that much remains to be done before we can justly lay claim to tha
noble and refined excellence which ought to adorn a great, a prosper-
ous, and a free people? Who will deny, that, in the general scramble
after wealih, most of our citizens overlook the refined the beautiful, in
their too eager pursuit of the useful? Who will deny, ihat, with us,
even at the present day, the standard value of every discovery and im-
provement in science and the arts, is not, (as it ought to be,) ihe amount
it will add to the happiness of man-is not, its tendency to enlighten,
to refine, to liberalize him, and elevate him in the scale of being ; but
its ability to improve his condition in the mere matter of dollars and
cents ?--and that most of our systems of ednication, as well as the
branches taught in our schools, are exclusively shaped 10 this end ?--
INTELLIGENCE! And is this our standard of inielligence, flowing from
our boasted principles of enlightened freedom ? Has refinement, has
elegance, nothing to do with national excellence, with national great-
ness? Shall it any longer be said, that the breath of liberty blights the
fine arts, and banishes refinement ? Shall American freemen merii
the reproach of being a nation of misers !-I leave it to the legislators
and statesmen of our country to answer these interrogatories, and to
say, whether a state of prosperity has not arrived, which would justify
a more liberal course of policy in regard to our school-systems and
the encouragement of the fine arts-a course embracing, not only the
useful, but, also, the clegant:—and especially to decide, whether refine-
ment of manners (which would naturally flow froin such a course of poli-
cy) would be dangerous to the liberties of our country.
*** To the teacher it may be proper to remark, that one hundred and
eighty pages of this third edition, exactly correspond with the same
pages of the second edition; but that other parts of the work have been
enlarged, and slightly altered, and, it is hoped, for the betler. In order
to prevent farther alterations, however, the work has been stereotyped.

ADDRESS TO TEACHERS.
On a preceding page, the author has intimated, that most instructers are
lamentably deficient in their knowledge of elocution. The reproach contain-
ed in this allusion, was not levelled solely at teachers. That they are both
guilty and amenable for all their pedagogical sins of omission, the author
can hardly be so uncharitable as to believe. In their laudable and laborious
calling, he is aware that they have many difficulties to contend with, many
obstacles to surmount, many evils to encounter. Among these might be men-
tioned, bad books, perverse children, igņorant parents, and lean salaries. It
is not, therefore, reasonable to expect, that, while their means and opportu-
nities are thus utterly inadequate to such a task, teachers can accomplish
every thing which the enlightened and liberally-minded desire to see gained
by the noble business of instructing;
But notwithstanding all that may be said in extenuation of the defects and
negligences of teachers, the dignity and usefulness of their high calling,
mainly depend upon themselves. If they choose to elevate their profession,
by acting in concert, they have the power to do it. It behooves all, then, who
are thus devoted to the best interests of their fellow-beings, to look well to
their qualifications and their doings, and to see if there is not yet left room for
improvement.
It is not the author's object either to dogmatize, or to sermonize, to a class
of men in which many are to be found with whose names he would deem it
a high honour to be permitted to associate his own as an equal; but he is
anxious, if possible, to point a remark that will excite a spirit of emulation
among the spiritless, of ambition in the unambitious, and awaken all to a
sense of the high responsibilities of their calling, and of the undying honours
which will hallow the fame of those who excel in it. In accordance with
this object, he begs leave to call the attention of teachers to the small work
which he now presents to the publick, and to themselves in particular; and,
at the same time, without arrogance or fawning sycophancy, to express a
hope, that it will be found worthy to occupy a place as a class-book in
schools, and travel the rounds of usefulness as the relative and fellow.com-
panion of “English Grammar in familiar Lectures”-in reference to the ex-
traordinary and unexpected success of which work, he may doubtless be per-
mitted emphatically to say with Prospero, “Your breath has filled my
sails."
*** All necessary directions in regard to the method of teaching from this
manual, will be found where they ought to be dispersed through the pages of
the work.-It may be added, that the selected portion of this work, will be
found a suitable accompaniment of his Grammar, as a set of convenient and
useful ExERCISES IN PARSING. In order to adapt them to this purpose,
the author has taken much pains to correct them, and render them grain-
matical.
It is to be hoped that no teacher among those who have not hitherto paid
attention to the principles of reading, will be afraid to adopt this treatise as a
text-book. Most of the principles may be easily understood and applied in
practice. Hence, an enterprising instructer may very readily qualify himself
to teach elocution, by the very efforts he must employ in communicating a
knowledge of it to his pupils. It will be far better for the learner to under-
stand one-half of the principles of the science, than none of them. Let no
one, then, be afraid to undertake.

ELOCUTION.
ELOCUTION treats of the just pronunciation of
words arranged into sentences, and forming a dis-
course, and is here employed as synonymous with
enunciation, or delivery.
Pronunciation may be considered in a twofold
light. When applied to the correct sounds given
to single letters or single words without reference
to their mutual dependance on each other, it is
styled Orthoepy; but when extended to the just
enunciation of words arranged into sentences, and
depending on each other for sense, it is called
Elocution.
Elocution, in its most extensive sense, develops a set of
principles, and lays down a system of rules, which teach us to
pronounce, either extemporaneous thoughts, or written composi-
tion, with justness, energy, variety,

ESSAY ON ELOCUTION.
The first object of elocution is, to make a good reader; its
second object is, to make a good reader; its third object, to
make a good reader; its last and grand object is, to make an
accomplished and a powerful SPEAKER.
That the study of this science is capable of making great
orators of the generality of men, no one has the folly to con-
tend; but to suppose, that a legitimate argument against the
general utility of the science may hence be drawn, would be
equally unreasonable. To the auditor, the force and beauty
of every sentence uttered, and not unfrequently its meaning,
depend upon the manner in which it is pronounced. Not only
the stronger passions and emotions, such as love, joy, grief, pity,
sorrow, envy, anger, and remorse, admiration, approbation,
commendation, vexation, and reproof, courage, terrour, reproach,
and the like, require each its peculiar intonation, but, likewise,
all the less prominent affections and feelings."
In uttering our own thoughts we are not so liable to depart
from the simplicity of nature, as we are in expressing the senti-
ments of others. By a misconception of the spirit and design
of the author, readers and speakers often mar, and sometimes
totally pervert, his meaning. Hence the importance of atten-
tion to rules, by the observance of which, misconceptions and
erroneous modes of utterance may generally be avoided, and
the sentiments of the author be expressed in a manner, at once,
agrecable and impressive.
It is not, perhaps, possible to lay down rules for the manage-
ment of the voice in reading and speaking, by which all the
necessary tones, pauses, emphases, modulations, and inflections,
may be discovered and put in practice. To accomplish this,
much depends on the judgment and natural taste of the learner;
and much more, on the example and instructions of the living
teacher. Yet it will not be denied by those who are compe-
tent to decide, that strict attention to a set of judicious rules,
grounded in the nature of language and the philosophy of the
human voice, will prove highly serviceable to such as are at-
tempting to form a chaste and an accurate enunciation. If it
be admitted, that principles and rules are useful in the attain.
ment of any art or science, it cannot be denied that they are
equally so to the votary of the science of reading and speaking,
But in order to approach perfection in any art or science,
attention to rules alone will be found insufficient. The student
in elocution should remember, that the vocal powers, like those
of the mind or the other powers of the body, are strengthened
and matured, and brought under subjection, only by a long and

persevering exercise of them. For his encouragement, also,
he ought to bear in mind, that those functions of voice exerted
in speech, are as susceptible of improvement by cultivation and
practice, as those, for example, which are employed in singing.
Who would expect to attain a high degree of excellence in play-
ing upon a wind instrument, without frequently blowing upon
it ? or to become a skilful mechanist, without learning the
names and use of the tools of that art to which he was devoted ?
or to become a clear and sound reasoner, without carefully and
frequently exercising his thinking and reasoning faculties upon
different subjects and in various methods ? Let no one, then, cher-
ish the thought, that he can excel in elocution, without a careful
attention to the nature, and character, and application of the
principles of the science: but, at the same time, let the am-
bitious student bear in mind, that, as by strict attention to
principles and rules, and by long practice, with native endow-
ments by no means extraordinary, the vocalist attains a perfec-
tion in harmony which awakes the soul to the enjoyment of the
most delightful emotions; the musician is enabled to produce
those thrilling and spirit-stirring sounds which affect the feel-
ings and the senses as if drawn out by the voice of a heavenly
enchanter; the mechanist, to rear a monument of skill and in-
genuity which calls forth the plaudits of an admiring world,
and carries down his name to posterity; the mariner, to trav-
erse the vast wilderness of unknown waters, and reveal to his
fellow men their distant islands and boundaries; the logician,
to penetrate the dark depths of errour and chaos, and bring up
from among the rubbish the precious pearls and gems of truth;
the philosopher, to pierce the veil of ignorance and speculation,
and ascertain and establish the true system of the universe; the
geologist, to disclose the treasures buried in the bowels of the
earth; the painter, to make the russet canvass glow with life;
and the sculptor, to make the inanimate marble breathe; so, by
similar attention and exertions, he may learn to make that
which is dull in composition, appear interesting; that which is
commonplace, novel; that which is plain, elegant; and what is
tame, eloquent; and in short, to bring out of that which is
truly excellent, all those latent beauties and rich graces of
thought, in such a manner as to excite the deepest interest, and
elicit the highest admiration, of his auditors.
A good reader has always at his command, not only a vast
field of the most refined and rational enjoyment-even the
whole field of literature and science-over which he himself
may revel, but, also, the ability to conduct others into it, hy a

way, at once, the most enticing and delightful. In this respect,
he possesses so enviable an advantage over common people as
to render it a matter of astonishment that we so seldom meet
with one thus endowed. When occasion calls forth his peculiar
talent, he appears among them like the stately magnolia, tower-
ing above the vulgar trees of the forest, and shedding upon them
the sweet fragrance of its blossoms.
But what a disagreeable contrast is presented in the perform-
ance of a bad reader! In his hands, the most glowing senti-
ments appear tame; the most burning thoughts are congealed;
attick wit becomes burlesque; satire is rendered pointless;
beauty is transformed into deformity; and all ornaments of
style wither; and thus, a piece of the most polished and
eloquent composition, appears to as great a disadvantage as
would a pleasure-garden with its walls overturned, its gravel-
walks marred, its fountains and statues dilapidated, its trees
and shrubbery scathed, and its plants and flowers trodden down.
Who can behold, with delight, a racehorse with a broken
limb ? a bird with a crippled wing? a plant growing crooked ?
or a beautiful stream choked up with sedges and rubbish? And
yet, how often do we witness a far more painful spectacle in
the exhibition of one of those literary monsters vulgarly called
bad readers! Before the performance commences, we have
displayed the insipid formalities of the prelusive scene, during
which our champion of vocal utterance is devoutly engaged in
bringing his body to an artificial bearing, in adjusting his
collar
and cravat, in smoothing down his visage, and in putting his mouth
in a proper posture for the wordy combat. A few moments
having been taken up in acting this distressing prologue, he at
length gets under way; but having mistaken his key-note, our
ears are assailed with a piercing and unseemly shrillness of
tone, which affects us about as agreeably as the unexpected cry
,
of a snipe or a killdee, or the creaking of a rusty hinge; or
he advances in a hoarse, dissonant, croaking tone, as if in imi-
tation of the combined powers of the peacock, the bullfrog, and
the alligator, which may be supposed to have joined in a con-
cert; or, perhaps, with a view of correcting his mistake, he
suddenly falls into a dull, disagreeable, dragging, humdrum
monotone; or gallops off on the sharp back of a quaver: and
not to be daunted by the most gigantick obstacle, he prances, and
,
paces, and hobbles, and flounders along through his performance,
to the infinite disgust, and inexpressible mortification, of his hear-
ers. His articulation is indistinct; his pronunciation, affected;
his accentuation, erroneous; his emphasis, misapplied; all ap-

propriate inflections are reversed; pauses are either perverted
or trampled under foot; melody is put upon the rack, and har-
mony expires; all rules are set at defiance; correct taste is
put out of countenance; the meaning of the author takes the
alarm and escapes from view; the modesty of nature is put to
the blush; and the whole group of proprieties is sent jibbering
down to chaos.
To see a piece of elegant composition tattered and torn, and
mutilated and mangled, by such a reader, is severer torture than
to listen to the jarring notes of a discordant choir, to an untun-
ed organ, or to a cracked fiddle. I would rather ride post over
a hubby road in December; walk barefoot over a sandy plain
in July; or be compelled to live a fortnight in a smoky house;
or to devour a Ratcliffe novel at one meal; or to read a chapter
in Basil Hall's Travels, or a page in Emmons' Fredoniad, or a
critique on an American writer in the London Quarterly, than
to have my nerves agitated; my understanding stultified, and
my patience exhausted, by listening to such a vile performer on
the grand harmonicon of human language. I would rather lis-
ten to the croaking of frogs in the winter-I would sooner
hear an owl hoot on a Sunday, or a simpering dandy chat with
a belle-I would sooner listen to the buzzing of a moscheto of a
hot summer's night, or to a patent-jenny-spun
speech in Congress
on the Tariff Bill, or to the thrumming of a dandyzette at her
piano, or to a band of musicians playing upon baseviols and
bassoons- I would rather hear the jingling of broken glass
upon a pavement, or the trampling of feet through crusted snow,
or a group of madcap boys bellowing after a fire-engine, or the
refusal of a friend to lend me money, I would sooner hear a
woman scold, or a child squall, than be compelled to listen to
an affected speaker, or a bad reader.
To urge upon this community the importance of this science,
may, nevertheless, be considered, by many, like attempting to
prove the correctness of the plainest
, self-evident proposition;
but when we reflect, that in our seminaries of learning, the study
of elocution meets with greater neglect than any other of equal
importance, and that the consequent ignorance of its principles,
often betrayed by tutors and learned professors in the presence
of their pupils, by students in their recitations and declamations,
by publick speakers in the pulpit
, at the bar, in publick assem-
blies, and in our legislative halls; ignorance which, were it
ovinced by the same individuals, in any other equally important
branch of learning, would inevitably expose them to the pity, if
not to the contempt, of their auditory when we bring these

facts into consideration, is it not clear, that every argument
should be adduced, every honourable motive urged, and every
passion addressed, which is calculated to awaken the attention
of the young, and direct it to the momentous advantages result-
ing from the proper cultivation of this science? To say nothing
of the arguments which might be drawn from the devotion of
the ancients to this subject, there is one of sufficient weight
nearer at hand, arising out of the mortification experienced by

ELOCUTION may be treated under the six follow-
ing, general heads:
1. ARTICULATION,
4. FORCE,
(Embracing Accent and Emphasis,)
2. TONES,
5. TIME,
(Including Modulation)
(Including Pauses,)
3. INFLECTIONS,
6. ACTION.
The first four of these divisions, are merely the names of
properties or qualities belonging to the human voice; the fifth
is a circumstance accompanying its movements; and the sixth,
a concomitant of good delivery.
CHAPTER I.
OF ARTICULATION.
A good ARTICULATION consists in a clear, full,
and distinct utterance of words, in accordance
with the best standard of pronunciation.
Importance of Articulation.
A distinct and an accurate articulation forms the ground-
work of good delivery. So important a quality is this to a
reader or a speaker, that, without possessing it, in some tolera-
ble degree, he will never be listened to with attention or in-
terest.
A clear and distinct ARTICULATION, so far from consti-
tuting, as is too often supposed, merely an incidental and indif-
ferent characteristick of a good reader or speaker, is, in fact, a
primary BEAUTY,-indeed, the GRAND BASIS upon which
all other beauties and excellences of enunciation rest. The
learner must not, therefore, be either discouraged or disgusted
with the dryness and tediousness of the following explanations

and exercises upon the elementary sounds of the language; but
he ought resolutely to persevere until he gains a complete
mastery over them. When he has at command a clear and
distinct articulation, he will be prepared to prosecute, to advan-
tage, those higher and more interesting parts of elocution.
The most important directions for acquiring a good articula.
tion, will doubtless be found most convenient if presented in the
form of Rules.
RULE I.
Particular regard should be paid to a clear and
distinct pronunciation of the elementary sounds
employed in vocal utterance.
OF THE ELEMENTARY SOUNDS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
There are thirty-five elementary sounds* em-
ployed and combined by the voice in pronouncing
the various words of our language. Some of
these sounds are represented by the twenty-six
letters which constitute the English Alphabet;
and others, by combinations of two or more of
these letters.
A perfect Alphabet would consist of a separate symbol for
every elementary sound; but the letters of our alphabet, being
imperfect in this respect, are employed to represent the sounds
which denote their names, and, also, other elementary sounds
employed in the utterance of syllables. Hence, there is often a
material difference between the elementary sounds heard in
pronouncing syllables, and represented by particular letters,
and those sounds which constitute merely the names of the same
letters. A few examples may serve to point out this difference,
which ought to be specially attended to in practising upon the
elementary sounds of the human voice.
In the words a-pe, a-che, a-te, the sound of the element a,
corresponds with the sound given to the name of that letter ; but
a different elementary sound is represented by the same letter
in the words a-ll, b-a-11, f-a-ll; and a sound still different in a-t,
h-a-t, th-a-t; and yet another sound in b-a-r, m-a-r, a-rbour.
In the word n-o-te, the letter o, represents the sound given to
its name; but in the word n-o-t, it is the representative of quite

ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.
a
a
a different elementary sound, and of a sound slightly different
again in the word n-o-r; to which may be added a fourth ele-
mentary sound in m-o-ve. Similar remarks might be extended
to e in m-e, imp-e-rative, m-e-t, to i in p-i-ne, p-i-n, to u in l-u-te,
h-u-t, f-u-ll; but these variations in the sounds of the vowels,
are familiar to every one, although every one has not noticed,
that these five vowels are employed, without combining them,
as the representatives of fifteen, distinct, elementary sounds of
the voice. Th in th-ink, has a different sound from th in wi-th,
th-is. Ch in ar-ch-angel, represents the elementary sound com-
monly denoted by k, but quite a different sound in ar-ch-er. As
these graphick characters called letters, then, are employed to
represent, not only the sounds which denote their names, but,
also, other elementary sounds which enter into the pronuncia-
tion of syllables, the aspirant for excellence in elocution, should
deem no attention too minute-no course of labours too arduous,
which may be found requisite in order to obtain a complete mas-
tery of all their elementary sounds.
There are many elementary sounds for the representation of
which we have no single letters. To make up this deficiency
in our alphabet, these sounds are represented by two or more
letters combined. By pronouncing the words th-ump, brea-th,
brea-the, so-ng, sh-ut, wh-at, ch-ur-ch, ou-t, in a slow and drawl-
ing manner, it will readily be perceived by those who have not
heretofore attended to the subject, that the combinations th, the,
ng, sh, wh, ch, and ou, express each an elementary sound which
is not represented by any single letter in the alphabet.
The same letter is not only employed to represent different
elementary sounds, but the same elementary sound is often ex-
pressed by various letters, or by various combinations of letters.
În the words s-o-n, d-o-th, d-o-es, the letter o, is employed as
the representative of an elementary sound commonly expressed
by u, as in s-w-n, d-u-th, d-u-z.
In the words p-u-pil, n-ew,
1-zeu, view, b-eau-ty, the letters u, ew, ieu, iew, and eau, are
employed to represent one and the same elementary sound, a
sound commonly denoted by u. The e in th-e-re, ei in th-ei-r,
and ai in ai-r, have the same sound as a in sn-a-re.

OF THE RADICAL AND VANISHING MOVEMENT OF THE VOICE.
Among the wonderful contrivances of nature in directing the
operations of the vocal powers in the production of speech, in no
one thing has she displayed greater wisdom than in that which
relates to the simple elements called by Dr. Rush, the Radical
and Vanishing movement of the voice. To this philosophical
inquirer, the world is indebted for the following analysis of these
important functions.
If the vowel a be pronounced without intensity or emotion,
and as if it were a continuation, and not a close, of utterance,
two successive sounds will be heard : the first, the nominal sound
of the letter a, issuing from the vocal organs with a certain de-
gree of abrupt fulness; the last, a feebler sound of the element
è, which gradually diminishes until it terminates in silence.
Example: He proved that a—is a diphthong:
To the unpractised student, the diphthongal character of a
will be more clearly demonstrated, if its sound be protracted,
and uttered with an emotion of surprise, at the close of an inter-
rogation : thus, · Do you call that a ?"
The character of this opening fulness and feebler vanish,
may be still more clearly manifested by pronouncing the element
in the following, various ways: let the opening be strong and
full, and the vanish less forcible, with a pause between the open-
ing sound a and the vanishing sound e, and then a shorter
pause, and then a shorter still, and so on, until both the opening
a

RADICAL AND VANISH.
and the vanish become blended into one sound: thus, A-,
A-, A-e, a-e, R.
Similar experiments may be practised upon the diphthongs,
i as heard in 2-sle, y in dr-y, and ou in our ; and upon the simple
elements, e as heard in ee-l, o in 00-ze, and so forth.
This opening fulness of sound here described,
Dr. Rush has denominated the Radical movement,
because the following or vanishing portion of the
elementary sound, rises (in the rising vanish) con-
cretely from it as from a base or root: and the last
portion he calls the Vanishing movement, on ac-
count of its becoming gradually weaker, until it
finally dies away into silence.
QUESTIONS.
Please to illustrate the diphthongal character of a, by pronouncing it
in such a manner as fully to display its radical and vanishing movement
of sound.

EXERCISES.
Explode the following vowels in such a manner (that is, by
protracting or lengthening them) as to show their diphthongal
character in the radical and vanishing movements of the voice,
namely, a in a-te, p-a-y, d-a-ta-i in i-sle, ż-tem-o in o-men,
Cat-o_ou in ou-nce.
Express the following italicised vowels with a protracted,
rising vanish: Did he call it a? Did she say i? Shall I pro-
nounce o? Can you sound ou?

Explode the same with a stress on the radical and vanish.
Explode them with the downward, protracted vanish: thus,
He called it a. She said i. I pronounce it o. You can sound ou.
In the same manner with stress upon the radical—upon the
vanish—upon the radical and vanish.
DIVISION OF ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.
The hoary division of the letters of our alphabet into vowels
and consonants, handed down to us from the Greek and Roman
etymologists, does not seem to be strictly philosophical, nor fully

.
a
descriptive of their relative characteristicks. A consonant is
not only capable of being perfectly sounded without the help
of a vowel," but, moreover, of forming, like a vowel, a separate
syllable.
Dr. Rush has judiciously adopted a division and classification
of the elementary characters of our language, in accordance
with their use in intonation, as follows:
The elementary characters of our language,
are divided into three sorts, the Tonicks, the Sub-
tonicks, and the Atonicks.
The Tonick elements are those whose sounds
display, the properties of the radical and vanish
in the most perfect manner.
There are twelve of
them; and they are heard in the sounds common-
ly given to the separated italicks in the following
words :
A-te, a-rk, a-ll, a-t, ec-1, e-rr, e-nd, i-de, i-t, o-ld,
00-ze, ou-t.
а
The tonick sounds consist of a distinct vocality, or raucous
quality of voice, by which they are contradistinguished from
aspirate or whispering sounds. They have a more musical
quality than the other elementary sounds, and may be uttered
with greater abruptness and force. They are also capable of
indefinite prolongation; and admit of the concrete and tremulous
rise and fall through all the intervals of pitch.
The Subtonick elements possess, variously, but
in an inferiour degree, properties analogous to
those of the tonicks. Whilst they admit of being
intonated, or carried concretely through the in-
tervals of pitch, they are inferiour to the tonicks
in all the emphatick and elegant purposes of
speech. There are fourteen of them; as,
B-oat, d-are, g-ilt, v-ice, z-one, y-e, w-o, th-at,
a-z-ure, so-ng, l-ate, m-ate, n-ot, r-oe.
Of the subtonicks, b, d, g, ng, l, m, N; , have an unmixed
vocality ; v, 2, y, w, th, zh, have an aspiration joined with their
vocality. M, n;ng, b, d, g, are purely nasal elements; the rest
of the subtonicks, are partly oral.

Chap. I.
DIPHTHONGS AND MONOTHONGS.
27
The Atonick elements are mere aspirates, or
currents of whispering breath. They are not
properly vocal sounds; have but a limited power
of variation in pitch; and supply no part of the
concrete movement when breathed among the
constituents of syllables. There are nine of them,
as heard in the words,
U-p, a-t, lar-k, i-f, thi-s, h-e, wh-at, th-in, blu-sh.
Although the aspiration of the atonicks, is both significative
and emphatick, yet it has no musical quality in its sound, and
affords no basis for the functions of the radical and vanish.
Three of the subtonicks, b, d, and g, and three of the atonicks,
p, t, and k, possess the explosive character in an eminent de-
gree, as in uttering them, the breath bursts out after a complete
occlusion.
These seven of the tonick elements, a-te a-rk, a-ll, a-t, i-de,
o-ld, ou-t, have different sounds for the two extremes of their
concrete movement; but the other fivé, ee-l, e-rr, e-nd, oo-ze,
¿-t, have each, one unaltered sound throughout the same move-
ment;—which fact the student is requested to demonstrate by
experiment.
The tonicks are divided into Diphthongs and
Monothongs.
The seven tonicks, a-te, a-rk, a-11, a-t, i-de, o-ld,
ou-t, are Diphthongs, because the sounds of the
radical and vanishing movement are different ;
but the remaining five, ee-1, e-rr, e-nd, oo-ze, i-t,
are called Monothongs, as their radical and van-
ish are alike in sound.
7
a
A-ll has for its radical, the sound of a in all, and for its van-
ish, a short and obscure sound of the monothong e in e-rr.
A-te has for its vanish, e in the monothong ee-l.
I-de has its radical followed in like manner by a vanish of the
monothong ee-1
O-ld has for its vanish, the monothong oo-ze.
Ou-t has for its vanish, the same monothong oo-ze.
For å farther illustration of this subject, the reader is referred
to Dr. Rush's " Philosophy of the Human Voice," page 59.

The pupil should practise upon the subtonick and atonick
elements until he becomes perfectly familiar with all their
sounds. In order to gain a mastery over them, let him, in ex-
ploding them, make a pause between each of them and the
tonicks with which they are combined: thus, b-e, t-o, v-ice,
a-n-d, i-t, ch-ea-p-e-n, s-a-t-i-n, and so forth.
OF THE FORMATION OF SYLLABLES.
The foregoing development of the elementary sounds, and of
the radical and vanishing function, furnishes information which
completely lays open the doctrine of syllabication.
In treating this subject, Dr. Rush philosophically illustrates
the three following, important points:
The peculiar operations of the voice in the
pro-
duction of syllables—The circumstantial causes
of their length—The basis of the rule which
ordains but one accent to a syllable.
The radical and vanishing movements of the
voice, constitute the essential properties of a syl-
lable.

FORMATION OF SYLLABLES.
Every syllable consisting of one or more elementary sounds,
derives its characteristicks of length and singleness of impulse,
from the concrete movement, and from the various properties
of the tonick, subtonick, and atonick elements of which it is
composed. Then, as the concrete movement of the voice through
a tone or other interyal of ihe scale, is the essential function of
a syllable, it follows, that each of the tonick elements, may, by
itself
, form a syllable; for none of these can be pronounced
singly, without producing the radical and vanishing movement.
It follows, also, from the assumed causation of a syllable, that
two tonick elements cannot be united in one syllable, or one vo-
cal impulse; for each having its own radical and vanish, they
must necessarily produce two syllables. We find, therefore,
that whenever two or more tonicks are in sequence, each forms
(except when silent), a separate syllable.
From what has been said, it will readily be perceived, that,
as the atonick elements have not the radical and vanishing con-
crete, they cannot produce distinct impulses, and, consequently,
when joined with tonicks, do not produce separate syllables.
If
the word olio, or Ohio, be properly pronounced, or so as to give
each of the three tonicks its radical and vanish, it will be im-
possible to condense them all into one impulse or syllable.
Similar remarks are applicable to the words aorta, Eta, Ion,
or any others including two or more tonick elements. But in
the word speaks, the syllabick function is contained in the ton-
ick ee-l, whilst the atonicks s, p, k, and s, add to the time, but
do not destroy the monosyllabick character of the word.
In regard to the various lengths of syllables, considered with
out reference to prosodial quantities, or to those abridgments and
prolongations of voice adopted for the purpose of oratorical ex-
pression, it may now be shown, that they are unalterably fixed
by the constituent elements of which they are composed.
The length of a syllable is increased, in the first place, by
adding atonicks to a tonick: thus, by adding, for example, f to
a, the syllable fa is formed; and if to these, the atonick c be
subjoined, the word face will be longer than the element a, or
the syllable fa; and still the triple compound will be but one
syllable, as it can have but one concrete movement. Although
the atonicks may be distinctly heard, (e is mute,) as forming a
part of the length of the syllable, yet, as they are incapable of
the concrete function, the transition through the given interval,
is made altogether an a, as if the word consisted only of that
element.
Secondly, if the subtonick 7 be prefixed to the tonick a, the
C
3*

ESSAY ON ELOCUTION.
a
syllable la will be longer than a, but will still have but one
function of the radical and vanish ; for when a subtonick is ut-
tered before a tonick, the vanish of the subtonick does not occur :
its radical continues on a level line of pitch, till the tonick opens
on that line with a more emphatick radical, and carries on the
concrete of the syllable. If to la, the subtonick v be aífixed,
the compound lave will be still longer than la, and its syllabick
character will still be preserved by the singleness of its radical
and vanishing movement. In the pronunciation of lave, the in-
tonation of l and a will be as before, except that a will not move
quite through the concrete, before v will fall in with it, and thus
complete the vanish of the syllable.
When an abrupt atonick is affixed and another prefixed to a
short tonick, as in cat, pet, tik, they form the shortest syllables
in the language: and in the pronunciation of such syllables,
however short they may be, the concrete movement of the rad-
ical and vanish, is still performed. This union of abrupt ele-
ments with tonicks, is a third mode of preserving the unity of
syllables, with a variation of their length.
A fourth mode of combining elements, is, by a union of all
the four kinds in one syllable: and this arrangement produces
the longest syllables in the language. Whenever there is a
pause after a subtonick, and, consequently, whenever it is utter-
ed singly, or at the close of a syllable, it unavoidably takes
the concrete movement: and the same thing occurs when it is
followed by an atonick; for, in this case, there is a termination
of vocality. It follows, therefore, that whenever both subton-
icks and atonicks are prefixed and affixed with a tonick in
forming a syllable, the atonicks must be placed on the extremes,
otherwise, the single, syllabick impulse would be destroyed.
In pronouncing the words strange (properly strandzh) and
strength, but one radical and vanishing movement is performed
on each; and the syllabick unity, or singleness of impulse, is
preserved by the peculiar arrangement of the various kinds of
elements of which they are composed. Each of these consists
of seven elementary sounds, which is the greatest number that
the nature of the elements admits of being combined into one syl-
lable. It will readily be perceived, that if the atonick and sub-
tonick elements in these words, were transposed, so as to re-
move the former from their appropriate places on the extremes,
as in the arrangement rstange, srtange, trsange, all the ele-
ments could not be pronounced in one syllable.
To the inquiring mind, it cannot but be interesting thus to
discover, that, in the formation of syllables and words, which,
a

66
to the ordinary observer, appear to be composed of letters acci-
dentally thrown together, and, as it were, grouped at random,
nature, silent and unseen, has all the while superintended her
own handiwork, and directed the whole operation by the un-
alterable and most rigid rules of philosophy.
From the influence of the radical and vanish, the constituents
of a syllable, the duration of its utterance is quickly arrested.
The nine atonicks, and the three abrupt subtonicks, cause an
interruption to the continuity of the syllabick impulse ; and the
mingling of the different elements, must give one of these inter-
rupters of sound, a position in every third or fourth place among
the tonicks and the other subtonicks, and thereby set a limit to
the duration of syllabick sound. For farther information on
this subject, the student is again referred to the Philosophy of
the Human Voice," p. 72.
The foregoing development shows, that a syllable may con-
sist of one elementary sound, or of several. The word mat, for
example, to one unaccustomed to a scientifick analysis of the
elements of speech, may appear to be one indivisible sound, ut-
tered by a single impulse of the voice. A little attention, how-
ever, to the operation of the vocal organs in pronouncing it, will
enable any one to perceive, that there are in the word, three,
distinct, elementary sounds. In producing these sounds, and in
combining them in such a manner as to form the word MAT, in
the first place, the lips are pressed together in a peculiar man-
ner, and, at the same time, air being forcibly impelled through
the nostrils, а sound is heard which somewhat resembles the
lowing of an ox." The sound thus produced, is the one repre-
sented by the letter m. The mouth is then opened, through
which air is emitted, and in its passage from the throat, so mod.
ulated by the action of the palate, tongue, and other organs of
speech, as to produce the sound represented by the tonick A, as
heard in the word a-t. Lastly, the tip of the tongue is pressed
.
against the roof of the mouth, and by a simultaneous action, air
is again impelled from the throat, and the tongue is withdrawn
from the roof of the mouth; and thus, that peculiar element is
produced which is denoted by the abrupt atonick T.
By pro-
nouncing the word very slowly, the three elementary sounds
here described, may readily be perceived.
Similar experiments on the words MAN, NOT, GET, BUD, FAR,
and the like, will show that each is composed of three, distinct,
elementary sounds.

strow'dst.
REMARKS.
These explanations are given with the hope, that they will
enable the unpractised student, by a little attention, readily to
analyze any word, and ascertain what its elementary principles
are: for, indeed, it is but too true, that many a one who passes
for an accomplished speaker, is yet quite ignorant of both the
number and the character of the elementary sounds of his lan-
guage; and what is still more to be deplored, owing to the same
species of ignorance, many a teacher is utterly incapable of
correcting the perverted and defective enunciation of his pupils.
It may not, therefore, be improper here to remark, that the only
expeditious and sure method of teaching a foreigner, or a na-
tive whose pronunciation is imperfect and corrupt, to pronounce
words according to their true idiom, and the best usage of
those who speak the language, is, by teaching him those ele-
ments in which he fails, separately, as single and detached
things, as well as to cause him to pronounce them in their com-
bined state.
Why does the foreigner or the half-taught child, say tinks or
dinks, instead of thinks? trift or drift, instead of thrift ? or dat,
instead of that? Why does he say tory, when he should say
story ? pos-ce, instead of pos-ts ? was-ce, instead of was-tes?
-
fores-ce, instead of fores-ts ? fif, instead of fif-th? lenth, instead
of len-gth ? and why all the other innumerable omissions, sup-
pressions, perversions, and distortions of the elementary sounds
which occur so frequently with those who attempt to speak our
language? The whole proceeds from a want of attention to the
proper method of exploding the elementary sounds: and, as pre-
viously stated, the only effectual remedy for such deficiencies, is,
to teach the elemental sounds SEPARATELY, as well as in
their combined state. It is in vain to attempt to correct such
។

defects by teaching pronunciation in the gross ; that is, by teach-
ing a pupil to pronounce, successively, whole sentences or parts
of sentences. No: the thing is altogether impracticable. He
must be taught, not merely to pronounce each word in which
he fails, separately, but each elementary part of the word sep-
arately. He must be taught to analyze every word in the pro-
nunciation of which he blunders, and practise upon each of its
elements until he can explode it clearly and perfectly.
This is a point of paramount importance to him who would
correct a bad pronunciation, either in himself or in others; and,
therefore, the teacher cannot be too particular in his attention to
it. Let him try the experiment upon one whose pronunciation
is extremely defective, and he will find, (if he has not already
tested the fact,) that any one whose vocal organs are not de-
fective, can be taught to explode clearly any and every elemen-
tary sound in our language, provided a practical example be
given to him of only one element at a time; and he will also
find—what the author has frequently tested in practice, and
what he, consequently, knows to be true—namely, that what-
ever elementary sound any one can pronounce singly and sepa-
rately, with a little practice, he can also pronounce correctly in
its combined state—in a syllable or a word.
By a little practice in exploding the element denoted by th in
think, withe, and the one represented by th in that, with, the
most superficial observer cannot but perceive the marked differ-
ence between them: and if a learner mistake the one for the
other, he should be exercised on each element separately from
the other letters of the word to which it belongs, until he per-
fectly understands their difference. In like manner, if he say
tinks, or dinks, instead of thinks, or lenth instead of length, or
posce, instead of posts, (and the last two errours, it should be
borne in mind, are as gross as the first two) he should be
taught the difference between the elemental, combined sound of
th, and that of t or d, which he had substituted for it. He
should likewise be made to know, by repeated experiments, that,
instead of exploding the elemental sound denoted by ng; in his
pronunciation of length, he had given merely the sound repre-
sented by n; and that in mispronouncing pos-ts
, his errour arose
from the omission of the sound of t, and of the s which follows it.
By being thoroughly exercised on the elementary sounds which
he is in the habit of suppressing or perverting, and thus being
led to the very bottom of the subject, the intelligent student will
soon discover wherein he errs, and, also, the cause of his errour.

mistake, and, at the same time, to know, for a certainty, that
we do correct it, and that we are able to avoid the like in fu-
ture, the only sure way is, to ascertain the cause of such errour,
evil, miscalculation, or mistake.
The foregoing directions under Rule 1, are mainly designed
for the use of the inexperienced and grossly defective in articu-
lation; but the following instructions may be found useful, not
only to readers and speakers in general, but even to many who
hold a very conspicuous rank as publick speakers.
Rule 1, inculcates the importance of pronouncing distinctly,
not merely every word (considered as a whole) which a reader
or a speaker utters, but every letter that enters into the orthog
raphy of each word, silent letters only excepted.
a
RULE II.
е
The sounds of the unaccented vowels, should
not be perverted nor improperly suppressed, but
fully and correctly exploded.
Examples; the u in popular, secular, singular, regular, par-
ticular, triangular, ridiculous, conspicuous, strenuous, &c.; the
o in opaque, opinion, opacity, oracular, omega; the e in esquire,
escape, esteem, estate, establish, espy, espouse, especial, estrange,
eruction, equipment, elopement, enough, enormous, evade, evert,
and the like; which are often improperly pronounced es-quire,
es-cape, es-teem, &c. We frequently hear gardn, suddn, kitchn,
hyphn, chickn, sulln, slovn, mountn, fountn, curtn, uncertn,
Latn, satn, rebl, chapl, gospl, instead of gardin, suddin, kitchin,
hyphen, chickin, sullin,
sloven, mountin, fountin, curtin, uncer-
tin, Latin, satin, rebel, chapel, gospel. This is extremely vul-
gar. But, in the words often, stolen, fallen, hidden, bidden,
chidden, even, open, heaven, leaven, seven, eleven, and many
others, the unaccented vowel e should not be sounded.
A far more fruitful source of errour, however, in which the
sound of the unaccented vowel e is either suppressed or per-
verted, is observable in the ordinary pronunciation of the ter-
minations ent, ment, nent, dent, lent, cient, tient, and the like;
as in different, monument, compliment, government, continent,
ardent, excellent, transient, patient. Instead of giving e its dis-
e
tinct, appropriate sound, as an accomplished speaker should do,
and as the rules ef orthoepy imperiously demand, doubtless
ninety-nine hundredths of those who speak our language, totally
pervert its sound in terminations like these; often pronouncing
it like short u; thus, differunt, monumunt, complimunt, govern.

UNACCENTED VOWELS.
,
Some men,
munt, continunt, ardunt, excellunt, transhunt, pashunt. Although
no stress is allowable on these terminations when un-accented,
yet that is no good reason for perverting the sound of e, which
should be pronounced here, as distinctly as in those termina-
tions that come under the accent; as in prevent, indent, unbent,
circumvent, and the like.
In a large class of words beginning with pre, the unaccented
e is apt to be suppressed. Precede, precise, predict, pretend,
predominate, prejudicate, and the like, are often articulated as if
written, pr-cede, pr-cise, pr-dict, pr-tend, pr-dominate, pr-judicate.
Orthoepy cannot look with complacency even upon this errour.
The unaccented o, in words commencing with pro, is also a
fellow sufferer with its harmless associate e, by its often falling
a victim to the same kind of unnatural treatment. Propose,
pronounce, produce, prorogue, promote, and so forth, are fre-
quently enunciated in such a manner as entirely to suppress
the
0 : thus, pr-pose, pr-nounce, pr-mote, and so on.
indeed, have no more mercy on innocent letters than if they
were invented merely to be tortured.
Poor e is also robbed of her just prerogative in the termina-
tions dence, ence, nence, lense, and so forth. Why should the
natural and rational sound dence, be exchanged for [a] dunce?
Yet we often hear residence, evidence, influencé, impertinence,
continence, silence, and the like, pronounced nearly as if writ-
ten, residunce, evidunce, influunce, impertinunce, continunce,
silunce.
But one of the grossest abuses of a vowel sound, occurs in
changing long u, in the unaccented syllable of such words as
the following, into u short. Natshure, featshure, creatshure,
lectshure, structshure, and so forth, are commonly pronounced
natshur, featshur, creatshur, lectshur, structshur; and by this
barbarous perversion, articulation is plundered of one of its
most delicate graces. There is not a more beautiful and vo-
luptuous sound in our language, than that given forth by u, in
such terminations, when pronounced as it should be. But words
which are musick, and which drop like honey from the comb,
as they issue from the lips of some men, fall, like the unwel-
come tones of untimely guests, grating on the ear, as they make
their exodus from the mouths of others.
In the words theorem, theorist, melody, plethora, and many
others, the sound of o is apt to be perverted, and changed to
that of short u.
A similar perversion of the sound of a, in the terminations
ant and man, is not uncommon. The words dormant, infant,

inhabitant, adjutant, reluctant, gentleman, and so forth, are fre-
quently pronounced as if written dormunt, infunt, inhabitunt,
gentlemun, &c. The long a in the last syllable of landscape,
is often improperly articulated like short i: thus, landskip.
In the presence of orthoepy, the words plausible, visible, pos-
sible, vivify, justify, stultify, and many other unlucky wights
belonging to the same clan, appear with an i knocked out; but
this excites not the least commiseration, for it is evident, that į
has attained this situation only by usurping the legitimate
throne of e: and that, although 2 may boldly assert his claims
to it in the presence of orthography, yet he is ever ready to
abdicate it when brought within the scrutinizing glance of
orthoepy.
RULE III.
The sounds of the consonants, especially when
two or three are combined, are often improperly
slurred or suppressed.
The sounds of the atonicks, t and final s, for example, in
such words as coasts, boasts, hosts, merit particular attention,
as they are often improperly omitted.
Theclump of subtonick and atonick elements at the termina-
tion of such words as the following, is frequently, to the no
small injury of articulation, particularly slighted; couldst,
wouldst, hadst
, prob'st, prob’dst
, hurl'st, hurl'dst, arm'st,
arm’dst, want'st, want'dst, turn'st, turn'dst, bark'st, bark’dst,
bubbl'st, bubbl'dst, troubl'st, troubl'dst.
Consonant sounds are, also, apt to be suppressed, where a
word begins with the same sound that closed the word next pre-
ceding it; as, " For Christ's sake;" "For mercy's sake."

Remarks.—The learner should be required to read the fore-
going exercises over and over again, again and again, until he
can articulate, with ease and accuracy, every vowel and every
consonant sound in each sentence. Those letters distinguished
by Italick characters, demand his particular attention: for an
attentive observer may easily be convinced, that few readers can
be found, who would not, in pronouncing these ten sentences,
be guilty of more than thirty inaccuracies.
The vowel o in the words of, for, from, and the like, is fre-
quently perverted to that of short u; and thus, one of the most
melodious and grateful sounds in the language, is lost.
One of the prominent points of articulation illustrated in these
exercises, is the frequent recurrence of a difficult sound at the
close of one, and at the commencement of another, word: such
as, "effects of, such an ocean, ought to approve, wastes and
deserts, Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw;" in which
instances, it will be found utterly impossible to give every ele-
ment its distinct sound without making a short pause between
the words. In the phrase, “ weight to throw,” for example, the
atonick t in weight, cannot be fully exploded unless a pause is
made after it. To this point, then, let the pupil particularly
direct his attention: for the suppression and blending of sounds,
as several of these examples clearly show, often lead to a total
perversion of the sense.
RULE IV.
The practice of hurrying over words so as to
precipitate syllable upon syllable, and, as it were,
blend them together into indistinct and confused
masses, is by no means allowable.
The least critical listener is always dissatisfied with an indis-
tinct speaker or reader, though, perhaps, utterly unable to point
out his particular faults; whilst the judicious observer has to
complain, that letters, syllables, words, and sometimes even
large portions of sentences, are either wholly suppressed by

confuse and perplex the mind in its attempts to apprehend their
meaning. Under a false conceit of beauty, some speakers allow
their voice to glide along through their sentences by attempting
to articulate and swell only what they conceive to be the most

every descent, to sink so
low as to elude the sight, the pleasure we derive from beholding
his flight, would be, in a great measure, destroyed. Precisely
in the same manner are we affected by the movements of the
voice. We are pleased with its waving, undulating motion;
but, in its progress, we like (if the figure may be employed)
always to keep in sight of it. Its descent, therefore, should never
be so great as to render the articulation indistinct.
The following examples may serve to illustrate Rule 4.

Remarks.-By pronouncing these sentences with rapidity
several times over, according to the corrupt orthography in
which they are presented, the precise elocution of many a reader
will be produced. After which, let any one pronounce the
same sentences with distinctness and energy, according to their
correct orthography in which they subsequently appear, obser-
ving to give every word and every letter its full and appropri-
ate sound, and the contrast will convince him of the magnitude
of the errours against which he is cautioned.

To avoid being misunderstood, in the foregoing remarks, it
may be proper to caution the student against confounding his
idea of distinct articulation, with that of emphasis, force, or
mere loudness of sound.
The tone of the voice may be very
low, and its force upon a syllable, word, or phrase, very slight
indeed, and, at the same time, the articulation, perfectly distinct,
and the enunciation, quite audible. To the reader or the speak-
er, this is a point of paramount importance. Whilst a dull uni-
formity of force and elevation would amount to unendurable
monotony, a succession of depressions that produce indistinct-
ness of articulation, is worse than the torture of Tantalus.
Va-
riety, therefore, in elevation and depression, force and softness,
quickness and slowness, should be studied; but, at the same
time, extremes are to be avoided.
a
AND.
There is no word in the language more frequently and unjust-
ly trampled upon, than the poor conjunctive drudge-and. No
slave was ever more grossly abused; and yet, its efforts are so
very laudable and friendly in its ever-active exertions to bring
together and unite its erratick and less social brethren, that it
would be extremely difficult for its enemies to hatch up the
shadow of an apology for bestowing upon it such a succession
of ill usages. Three times in four, perhaps, when it appears
at its post in the path of the speaker, it is passed by with
merely an imperfect and uncourteous nasal salute, as if it were
some obtrusive menial, unworthy of the least regard. In ex-
amples like the following, it is seldom half articulated. Al-
though it is as lawfully entitled to three, distinct elementary
sounds, as ever was an honest pronoun to its case, or a princely
verb to its tense, yet such is the ingratitude of poor, frail, clay-
built readers and speakers, that they think nothing of robbing
this most faithful and respectable servant of, at least, one, if not
two, or even two and a half, of its legitimate elements.

distinctly appear,

In pronouncing the phrase, “ And his," not only the a, but the

with that of the i following it; as if written thus, un diz cohorts,

for the express purpose of enabling the student, by strict atten-
tion to a distinct articulation of them, to avoid, in future, the
too common errour of slurring over such words, and especially
the vowel o, and other letters italicised--the chief source of that
enormous transgression of the laws of elocution and common
sense, by which many a reader blends words together in such a
manner as to present them in the lump. An elegant and im-
pressive elocution depends greatly on a distinct and appropriate
enunciation of terminating syllables and small words. Although
so great a force must not be given to them as to the larger and
more important words, yet they require a clear and distinct ar.
ticulation; for, without this, not only the beauty and harmony of
the language, but even its meaning, are either greatly obscured
or wholly destroyed. Who can peruse, with satisfaction, a let-
ter written in villanous, unreadable characters, or a book with
many of its pages torn out, and others mutilated, or a newspaper
with its columns mackled, monked, and friared? And yet, far
more disagreeable is it to one to listen to a speaker or a reader
who, by rising and falling, and quavering, and trilling, and
mincing, and puffing and swelling, and slurring and suppressing
sounds, presents you his own or his author's sentiments in so

Our best orthoepists have indicated, in their directions for
pronouncing the vowels a and e in such words as fare, rart,
where, there, their, air, chair, prayer, compare, declare, insnare,
and the like, that the same sound should be given to them as to
long a in fate, late; but this direction is either wrong, or not
generally understood, and has, consequently, betrayed some into
an affected pronunciation of such words--a pronunciation which
must be disgusting to every one of correct taste in elocution.
Whether such directions are the offspring of inattention on the
part of orthoepists, or whether they have arisen out of the diffi-
culties which trammel them in representing to the eye, merely
by the use of arbitrary characters, all the nice shades of differ-
ence in the sounds given to letters, is, to the student, a matter of
little moment; but of vast importance is it to him who would
become an accomplished reader or speaker, not to be led astray
by the false or imperfect directions of authors. There is nothing
that can expose one's reputation for accuracy and elegance in
delivery to greater hazards, than affectation in his pronuncia-
tion. Affectation in women, is sickening; in men, insufferable;
therefore, all kinds of affectation should be avoided.
Whose conception of natural sounds is so obtuse as not to
perceive a marked difference in the sound commonly given to
a in fate, and to the more open one of a in fare, e in there, their,
a in chair, prayer, compare, and so forth ? If it is a fact, then,
that this difference of sound is ordinarily made, the point is
easily settled: for the sounds a commonly given" to letters in
particular situations, (I mean, of course, sounds given, not only
by the common people, but also by the educated,) are the cor-
Primarily, a particular, graphick character, called in our
language, a letter, is no more the legitimate representative of a
particular sound, than is a pebble, or a blossom, or a silk thread.
How is it, then, that letters become the representatives of par-
ticular sounds ? Only by the general consent of those who adopt
and employ them, just as particular sounds and combinations of
sounds, called words, become the representatives of certain ideas.
Hence we see, that the general practice of those who employ
certain letters, to represent particular, vocal sounds, is the only
standard of accuracy in the use of those letters for such pur-
poses, and, also, that the same authority is paramount in the use
of words: and hence we perceive, too, that it is beyond the
province of the orthoepist to dictate in regard to the sounds that
may, or may not, be given to particular letters, as well as to the
grammarian, in regard to the use of words. No; the authority

of each is bound down by the superiour authority of general
usage: and from this last authority, there is no appeal. It is
true, the province of each allows him to ascertain what good
usage is, and to inculcate principles according to it, and to the
analogies and idioms of the language as far as sanctioned by
good usage; and, moreover, to point out bad usages, that is,
such as are not adopted by a great majority of the most intel-
ligent and the most learned; but farther than this, he cannot,
legally, go.
In pronouncing the words, jail, pail, sail, pray, lay, say, we
give to the vowel a precisely the sound of long a in fate; but
an attentive observer will readily perceive, that the sound of
this vowel is different, and becomes more open, and less pro-
longed, in air, chair, stair, prayer, and the like, when these
words are pronounced in a natural manner. If this is a true
statement of the case, this different sound commonly given to a
in fare, air, and so forth, is the correct one; and the attempt to
give the long sound of a, as in fate, to a in prayer, air, fare,
rare, compare, to e in there, and the like, is affected and erro-
There is, also, a more distressing affectation displayed by
many who, in the pronunciation of perfect, person, mercy, inter-
pret, determine, and the like, attempt to give the accented e the
sound of e in imperative. It is difficult to describe the affected
sound alluded to; but that it is not the same as e in met, as
Walker has directed that it should be, and that it is a shocking
outrage on good taste and common sense, are facts equally ap-
parent. The sound of e, when exploded in such words, ought
to approach as near to that of e in imperative as is possible,
without betraying the affected sound alluded to.
Another affected pronunciation of a vowel sound, which is
very common among the clergy of New England and New
York, deserves the most marked reprehension, as it is too sick-
ening to be endured by civilized beings. I allude to the sound
frequently given to a in heart, part, smart, and so forth. In-
stead of giving a, in words of this class, its correct sound, as
heard in far, bar, par, they attempt to sound it somewhat like e
in imperative.
But there is another affectation in exploding the diphthongal
sounds of y in sky, i in kind, ui in guide, ua in guard, and the
like, which is far more common than the last two referred to,
and but little less nauseating. Under a false view of elegance,
many pronounce these words as if written ske-i, ke-ind, ge-ide,
ge-ard. This is abominable, and a total perversion of the sounds

intended to be described and recommended by Mr. Walker.
The diphthongal sounds of y, i, ui, and ua, in such words, are
not represented by ei and ea when separately pronounced, but
when united and blended, as it were, into one sound. Hence,
the common people, who know nothing of the diphthongal char-
acter of these sounds, nor of Walker's directions concerning
them, generally pronounce such words correctly, and as Mr.
Walker intended they should be pronounced.
The y in my, when emphatical by being contrasted with some
other possessive pronoun, is pronounced like long i; but when
not emphatical, it may take the sound of short e, as in met.
To give i in wind, its long sound, as in mind, and ou in pour,
its legitimate sound, as in our, appears, in prose, a little affected,
because they are generally pronounced wind and póre, but
when these words rhyme with others, at the end of a line in
poetry, it is strictly in accordance with good taste, to give i its
long, and ou its diphthongal, sound.
For, as in bodies, thus in souls, we find
“What wants in blood and spirits, swelled with wind."
“Ye heavens! from high the dewy nectar pour,
"And in soft silence shed the kindly shower."
A strange perversion of the sounds of t and d is sometimes
made in words like the following: duty, produce, fortitude;
which are not unfrequently pronounced juty, projuce, fortitshude,
ingratitshude.
Under a false conceit of cleverness and elegance, some are in
the habit of giving the vowel a, in the words glass, pass, mass,
brass, flaunt, &c. demand, command, and the like, a flat
sound, somewhere between that of a in hat (its proper sound in
the first class of these words) and o in note.
Another disagreeable perversion often occurs in pronouncing
the termination ed as a separate syllable in those verbs in which
it ought to be contracted; such as walk-ed, talk-ed, lov-ed,
smil-ed, and the like; but, in the participial adjective, where
the ed should be sounded, it is frequently contracted: thus, “A
;?? “The bless-ed Redeemer;" are often pronounced,
“ A learn'd man;"
;" “ The bless'd Redeemer.'
But a more important caution is to be given in regard to the
pronunciation of the unaccented vowels e and a in such termi-
nations as ment, nent, dent, lent, cent-ence, nence, dence-
ant, nant, vant, man-lar, lance, and so forth. Although these
vowels should have their distinct, natural sounds in such words
as commandment, ardent, innocent, influence, confidence, infant,

covenant, servant, gentleman, secular, vigilance, and the like,
yet the slightest stress laid upon them, or the least effort to ex-

It waves as waved the palm of yore,
In days departed long and gone.
Twas twilight, for the sunless day went down
Over the waste of waters, like a veil,
Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown
Of one who hates us ; so the night was shown,
And grimly darkled o'er their faces pale,
And hopeless eyes, which o'er the deep alone
Gazed dim and desolate: twelve days had fear
Been their familiar; and now ,., DEATH was here!

There was no light in heaven but a few stars;
The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews:
Our ship then gave a heel—a lurch to port,
And, going down head foremost-sunk, in short.
Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell;
Then shrieked the timid, and stood still the brave;
Then some leaped overboard, with dreadful yell,
As eager to anticipate their grave :
And the sea yawned around her" in its swell,”
And down she sucked with her the whirling wave,
Like one who grapples with his enemy,
And strives to strangle him before he dies.
And first one universal shriek there rushed,
Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash
Of echoing thunder; and then...all was hushed,
Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
Of billows: but at intervals there gushed,
Accompanied with a convulsive splash,
A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
Of some strong swimmer in his agony.

Remarks.—In these examples, those letters most liable to an
indistinct or perverted articulation, are designated by Italick
characters. However imperfect such helps may be, it is hoped
that they will afford some assistance to the ambitious student,
and serve to direct the attention of the teacher to this particular
subject: and to both teacher and learner, the author begs leave
to suggest the propriety of frequently referring the corrections
made in reading the exercises, back to the principles that are
violated.
The unpractised student may deem a scientifick and an ana-
lytical development of the elementary principles of vocal sounds,
a procedure more curious than useful; but so erroneous would
such a conclusion be, that, on the contrary, he ought to consid-
er investigations of this description, of paramount importance
in the study of elocution. These elementary principles form
the only proper basis of the science; and the want of a knowl-
edge of them, is the principal cause of multitudinous errours in
reading and speaking. It is, therefore, incumbent on him who
would excel in the science of elocution, to obtain a perfect mas
tery over these elementary and primary principles, before he
proceeds to general reading:—and of the truth of these remarks,
the author trusts that enough has been displayed in the forego-
ing, imperfect development of the subject now under considera-
tion, to convince even the most skeptical.

RULE VII.
The practice of miscalling words, is a trans-
gression altogether inadmissible.
The besetting sin of careless readers alluded to in this Rule,
is an abomination altogether unendurable. In a child, it is in-
excusable; in an adult, disgraceful.
The following examples are sufficient to show, that the mis
calling of words, is not only capable of perverting the meaning
of a passage, but, sometimes, of giving it a meaning altogether
ludicrous.
EXAMPLES,
Correct Reading --Lysimachus, the governour of Alexander,
being an austere man, and a near relative of Olympias, inured
his pupil to hardy habits, which invigorated his constitution.
False Reading: -Lysimachus, the governour of Alexander,
being an auster man, and a near relative of Olympias, &c.
Correct.—And the Lord smote Abijah the Hittite that he died.
False. And the Lord smote Abijah Hi-te-ti-te that he died.
Correct.-And the Lord smote Job with sore boils.
False.--And the Lord shot Job with four balls.
RULE VIII.
A distinct articulation is greatly promoted by
protracting all such vowel sounds as will admit
of it.
A full, bold explosion, and lengthening out of the tonick ele-
ments, especially the long tonicks, add greatly to expression
delivery, and are absolutely necessary to the proper application
of emphatick force. The reader or speaker should be very
particular, therefore, to protract the vowel sounds, and make the
most of them he possibly can, without doing violence to the laws
of propriety. This subject is again referred to under the head
of Time Page 129.
QUESTIONS.
Please to repeat Rule 7th, and read the examples which follow it.
Repeat Rule 8th.
What adds to expression in delivery ?
Please to read the exercises under Rule 8th, and point out some of
the tonick elements which admit of lengthening.
Do any of the subtonick elements admit of protraction ?

In the following exercises, those vowels whose sounds ought to be
protracted, are distinguished thus: ā, ē, i, o, ů.

observed, that not only the tonick, but, also, the subtonick, ele-
ments frequently admit of protraction.
IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD ARTICULATION.
The prescribed limits of this Essay, render it impracticable
to pursue, to any great extent, investigations on this branch of
elocution. If enough has been presented to arrest the attention
of the learner, and excite in him a spirit of inquiry, the design
of the writer is accomplished: but he is unwilling to take leave
of this subject without laying before the reader a few more con
siderations that may urge him to push his investigations in this
department by his own individual efforts, and by an attentive
perusal (if he can procure them) of “The Philosophy of the
Human Voice by Dr. Rush, and of Dr. Barber's " Grammar
of Elocution."

a
words, is of vastly more importance than any and every other
good quality of utterance, any one may readily convince himself,
by attentively observing a few of our best, and of our worst,
speakers and readers.
What was that mighty charm by which the late John Ran-
dolph bound the senses, and seized the passions, of his auditors ?
As far as his manner of delivery was concerned, it must doubt-
less be obvious to every one that ever listened to him, that the
grand secret of his masterly power in oratory, lay in the dis-
tinctness of his ARTICULATION. The same may be said of our
Durbin : and, indeed, with him this appears to be, not only the
primary, but the PRINCIPAL, ingredient of that eloquence by
which he lays hold of the sympathies, and, as it were, with a
Timothean power, takes the hearts of His hearers captive at his
will, and transports them to the haven of bliss.
In farther confirmation of what I would enforce, I might cite
the example of Henry Clay, of Daniel Webster, of William
Wirt, of Alexander Hamilton, of Fisher Ames, of Henry Bas-
com, of John M. Duncan, of Alexander McClelland-of a
Summerfield, a Mason, and even a Master Burke, together with
a hundred other master spirits whose glowing geniuses adorn,
or have adorned, our western hemisphere. But the citation
would be gratuitous. No one has any thing more to do, than
to open the eyes of his understanding, to look, OBSERVE, and
BE CONVINCED. Let conviction, then, lead to attention
and PRACTICE. To young gentlemen, especially, who are just
launching their bark upon the waves of a professional life, this
appeal should be IRRESISTIBLE.
Who ever listened with rapture, or even delight, to a reader
or a speaker, whose articulation was indistinct ? The thing is
impossible-an absurdity-a mockery, which tramples upon
the philosophy of the human voice, and the elementary princi-
ples of human nature.
The first example cited, is, moreover, a remarkable instance
of the wonderful effects of industry and perseverance in over-
coming the obstacles of nature in order to the attainment of ex-
cellence in oratory; for who, unless it was Demosthenes him-
self, (whose voice was by no means similar,) ever possessed,
naturally, a more disagreeable, uncouth, piping, creaking voice,
than John Randolph of Roanoke? And yet, whose voice, by
cultivation, ever became so alluring, so fascinating, as his? It
fell on the ear like a soft strain of musick, and haunted the
hearer like the spell of an enchantress, or the soft murmur of a
distant waterfall. And the second example is no less remark-

able in showing what a bewitching charm-what a mighty
power may be wielded, by a voice naturally fine and feeble.
These examples are, also, .both instructive, as evincing the
importance of a reader or a speaker's adhering to the natural.
tones of his voice, be they, at first, ever so peculiar, disagreea-
ble, or unpromising. Although natural tones may be softened
down and attuned by cultivation, yet they must never be ex-
changed for artificiał ones; for the same holds true with the
voice, as with the sentiments, of an orator: both must be real,
and his own, or they will be rejected by his auditors, on whom
it is impossible to palm counterfeit ware. These examples
should also excite emulation in others. If, when labouring
under so great disadvantages, men have, by dint of application,
and attention to distinctness of articulation, attained such lofty
heights of excellence in the field of eloquence, what encourage-
ments are not held forth to those whose voices are naturally
strong and melodious !
Let no one plead, that, because a good articulation is gener-
ally neglected, it, therefore, becomes a matter of little moment.
It is a paltry trick of sophistry to bring forward the faults of
others for the purpose of extenuating our own misdeeds. This
mischievous delusion must always result disadvantageously to,
him who adopts it. No malefactor ever found the halter less
severe on account of the numerous victims which the gallows
claims.
It is a great mistake to suppose, that, in order to fill an ex-
tensive space, so as to be clearly understood by the most distant
hearer, a reader or a speaker must necessarily raise the pitch,
and increase the volume and force, of his voice. Who has not
observed, that partially deaf persons much more readily appre-
hend what is said to them in a clear, moderate tone of voice
that is perfectly distinct, than what is uttered in a loud tone,
and in a rapid and indistinct manner? Of course, the same
holds true in addressing an audience or an individual whose
sense of hearing is not impaired: and it is not a little singular,
that a consideration so important to publick speakers, is, by
them, so generally disregarded. If they would only reflect,
that the clear and distinct enunciation even of a feeble voice, is
far more efficacious than the boisterous precipitancy of a strong
one, it is apparent, that, at the bar, in the sacred desk, in our
legislative halls, and elsewhere, we should have more ...
speaking, and less ... bawling. With distinctness, the sing-
song whine of the most canting speaker, does more execution
than the voice of a Stentor without it. Although a fluent, and

even a rapid, flow of words, where the sentiments uttered, ren-
der it proper, is often advantageously adopted by a reader or
a speaker, yet his fluency should never be permitted to en-
croach upon a distinct articulation.
We readily understand, then, why the ancients regarded ar-
TICULATION as the primary requisite in delivery. This grand
quality being overlooked, all other acquisitions in oratory will
prove unavailing, or, in other words, will fall short of their ob-
ject, just in proportion to the neglect with which articulation is
treated.
The persevering efforts of Demosthenes, who, in order to
correct his faults in articulation, betook himself to speaking
with pebbles in his mouth, also when undergoing the labour of
walking up hill, and likewise amid the roar of dashing waves,
are as familiar to every one as an ordinary nursery tale-and
about as much regarded! But it would be doing great injus-
tice to that illustrious orator, to bring his genius down to the
same level with his who should, in our day, by the cultivation
of his vocal powers, attain the same height in eloquence that
he did. The modern candidate for oratorical fame, stands on
very different, and far more advantageous, ground, than that
occupied by the young and aspiring Athenian—especially
since a correct analysis of the vocal organs, and a faithful rec-
ord of their operations, have been given to the world by Dr.
James Rush of Philadelphia—a name that will outlive the
unquarried marble of our mountains. In his “Philosophy of
the Human Voice," this branch of learning is, for the first
time, reduced to a science, and established upon the unbending
principles of an inductive philosophy. By the lights of sci-
ence, then, which shone not upon the ancients, may the modern
votary of Hermes be guided on his way to the temple of fame.
QUESTIONS.
How may one convince himself of the beauty and importance of a
clear and distinct articulation ?
What speakers can you name as illustrative of it?
Which of these are remarkable for their perseverance in overcoming,
by oratorical culture, the obstacles of nature ?
Are artificial tones or sentiments admissible in a speaker ?
In order to fill a large space with the voice, is it requisite to raise its
pitch, or increase its volume and force?
What, then, is requisite ?-(a distinct articulation.)
Can you prove this by a reference to deaf persons
What did the ancients regard as the primary requisite in delivery ?
To what practices had Demosthenes recourse, in order to overcome
his impediments of speech?

CHAPTER II.
OF TONES AND MODULATION.
The word Tones, in its most comprehensive
sense, denotes the whole range of perfect sounds
,
which are produced, either by man, the inferiour
animals, or musical instruments: but, in a rhetori-
a
7
cal sense,
TONES consist in the various sounds of the voice
in its ascent from a low to a high pitch, or in its
descent from a high to a low one.
MODULATION denotes the variations of the tones
in their ascending and descending progressions
from one note to another.
To the wisdom and goodness of his Creator, man is indebted
for that peculiar endowment called the power of speech. In
order that he may be enabled to exert this faculty to the great-
est advantage in effecting all its important purposes, the same
divine wisdom and goodness have been displayed, in bestowing
those peculiar and various tones of voice which consti-
tute another characteristical feature of that pre-eminence which
he holds over the rest of the animal world. All animals, it is
true, express their various feelings by peculiar tones; but those
possessed by man, are the more delicate, melodious, and com-
prehensive, in proportion to the elevation of his rank in the
scale of being. There is not an act of his mind, an exertion of
his fancy, nor an emotion of his heart, which cannot be express-
ed in a manner exactly suited to the degree of his internal feel.
ing. Hence, it is chiefly in the correct and appropriate use of
these tones, that the life, the spirit, the beauty, and the harmony
of delivery consist.

A scientifick analysis of the speaking voice, may, perhaps,
be facilitated, by borrowing, under this head, the terms adopted

in musick. The notes or variations of tone within the compass
of the voice in reading and speaking, are the same in number
as those employed in singing.
The NATURAL or DIATONICK SCALE consists in
a succession of eight sounds either in an ascend-
ing or a descending progression.
The eighth sound or note in the scale, is called an Octave.
The diatonick scale consists of five tones and two semitones.
The distinction between the terms Note and Tone should be
carefully observed.
A Nore consists in a sound produced at any
point or place in the scale, considered without ref-
erence either to its rise or fall.
A TONE consists in the rise or fall of the voice
from one point in the scale to another, except the
spaces between the third and fourth, seventh and
eighth, places, which are occupied by semitones.
A SEMITONE consists in the rise or fall of the
voice through a space in the scale half as great as
that taken up by a tone.
The semitone is employed in the language of love, tender-
ness, petition, complaint, and doubtſul supplication.
If the words eyes and cruel, in the following example, be
pronounced in a plaintive manner, they will be uttered in
a semitone: “Put out my eyes! It is too cruel.”
A MONOTONE consists in the pronunciation of
several syllables in an unvaried tone; that is,
without that variety of tones which constitutes
modulation.
If, in reading the annexed example, the words poor and old
be pronounced in a plaintive tone, and each with a sameness of
sound corresponding with that of the other, it will illustrate
both the semitone and the monotone:
“Pity the sorrows of a poor old man."
It is possible to utter in a monotone, any succession of let-
ters, syllables, or words, even to an indefinite extent; but the
laws of melody require the monotone to be but sparingly em-
ployed.

a
INTERVAL. The distance between any two
points or places in the scale, is called an INTERVAL.
The intervals of the scale are numerically designated by in-
cluding both of the extremes: thus, when a sound ascends or
descends from the first place in the scale to the second, or from
the second place to the first—from the second to the third, or
from the third to the second, it is said to pass through the inter-
val of a second; when it passes from the first place to the third,
or from the third to the fifth, and so forth, it is said to pass
through the interval of a third ; and when it passes from the
first to the fifth place, or from the fourth to the eighth, through
the interval of a fifth : and so of the rest.
The QUALITIES or KINDS of voice are distin-
guished by the terms, rough, smooth, full, harsh,
soft, slender, and so forth.
ABRUPTNESS, as applied to the voice, denotes a
sudden and full discharge of sound, as contradis-
tinguished from its more gradual emission.
This abruptness of sound is well exemplified by the explosive
notes of a bassoon, and some other wind instruments.
2
а.
PITCH.
Pitch denotes the place in the musical scale, of
the sound or note we strike..
The upward and downward movements of the voice as it passes
through the various intervals of the diatonick scale, are either
conc? cte or discrete.
When the slide of the voice consists of one con-
tinuous, uninterrupted stream of sound, it is called
a CONCRETE sound; but when the stream of sound
is not continuous, that is, is interrupted in its de-
scent or ascent by breaks, it is called a DISCRETE
sound or movement.
RADICAL, CONCRETE, AND DISCRETE PITCH.
By pronouncing a vowel or a syllable, such as a, o, or name,
for example, with distinctness and fulness at the opening, it will
be perceived, if the sound be protracted, that the volume of voice
lessens during its slide, and that it passes off in a delicate van-
a

а.
ish until it terminates at the point where sound and silence seem
to meet. These slides of the voice are either upward or down-
ward, so that, as the voice moves along from syllable to syllable,
its relative pitch, or place in the scale, is, of course, continually
changing, except when it advances in a monotone.
This difference, or change in the position of the voice, is in-
dicated by Dr. Rush, by calling the pitch on which a syllable or
word begins, in comparison with the pitch where it terminates,
or of other, succeeding syllables, the RADICAL Pitch, in order
to distinguish it from the place or pitch at which the voice ar-
rives by its respective concrete or discrete movements; and this
last-named place of the voice, or point in the scale, is denoted,
relatively, either its Concrete or Discrete Pitch.
Every one must have observed, that he can pitch his voice
almost any where in the scale he chooses. If, in pronouncing
the letter o, a, or i, or the word lay, dote, or time, any one begin
by opening the radical on a very low note, and then continue to
repeat the same, by commencing one note higher, and then an-
other note higher, and so on, running it up the scale as high as
he can conveniently go, and then down again, in the same man-
ner that we “raise and fall the eight notes” in musick, (only
with the difference that he should not sing the letter or word,)
he may readily convince himself of the variety and compass of
the voice, in regard to pitch, which :nay be employed in reading
and speaking. Similar experiments may also be made in pro-
nouncing the following line, or, indeed, any other one.
“At the close of the day when the hamlet is still”-
In pronouncing this line, it may be proper to observe, the voice
should not be permitted to fall at its close, but it should be sus-
pended with the rising vanish, exactly as if something more
were intended to be added in order to complete the sense.
In reading or speaking to a small audience in a small room,
that pitch of the voice should generally be adopted which we
employ in ordinary conversation. This pitch being the most
natural, it will render our delivery the most easy to ourselves,
and the most agreeable to the hearer. In addressing a large
audience, it is proper generally to commence with the same or-
dinary pitch; but, as we advance, (especially in delivering our
own sentiments,) we naturally increase the force of our voice,
and allow it to slide into a higher tone; and if we become im-
passioned, and earnestly vehement, we do not "o'erstep the mod-
esty of nature" by raising our key-note several tones above the
one on which we commenced. Of the correctness of this rea

mark, any one may satisfy himself by observing the elevation
of tone assumed by persons speaking under the excitement of
the stronger passions.
Reading being "a correct and beautiful picture of speaking,”
those rules which instruct us in the latter, may, in general, be
properly applied to the former. To this position it has been
objected, that, "when reading becomes strictly imitative, it as-
sumes a theatrical manner, becomes improper, and gives offence
to the hearer.”' To the author, this objection does not appear
to be valid. To say that reading, by becoming “ strictly imita-
tive of speaking, assumes a theatrical manner," is no less than
saying, that speaking is performed in a theatrical manner.
This may sometimes be the case; but it is hoped that the day
is remote, in which it will generally be so, for nothing, it is
conceived, can be more directly opposed to genuine oratory,
than a theatrical manner of speaking. To the author, how-
ever, it has always been a matter of astonishment, that players
do not cultivate a manner of speaking less “ theatrical;" for he
has observed, that those rare geniuses among them who are
looked up to as paragons of excellence, are invariably less the-
atrical, and more natural, in their elocution, than players of
ordinary talents. He has also observed the same thing in ora-
tors. The greatest orators he has ever heard, are the most
NATURAL speakers.
The same remark may likewise be extended to singers.
There is a wide difference between cultivating the native pow.
ers, and perverting them, although the latter often passes cur-
rently for the former. If these observations are correct, a hint
may be drawn from them, worthy the attention, not only of the
player, but also of the preacher, the lawyer, the legislator, and
all others who wish to improve their oratorical or their vocal
powers.
In delivering his own sentiments, a speaker may justly be
more vivid and animated than in uttering the sentiments of
others. Hence, a greater degree of delicacy and moderation
is necessary in reading than in speaking. Care should be
taken, however, that this consideration do not lead the reader
into the fatal errour of becoming too tamé. A lifeless, indiffer-
ent, or cold, formal manner, should be assiduously avoided. The
animation, the earnestness, of the reader, ought nearly to equal
that of the publick speaker.

TONES-GENERAL RULE.
The following rule for the management of those tones that
indicate the stronger passions and emotions, is deemed worthy
the attention of every disciple in elocution: “In reading, let
your tones of expression be borrowed from those of common
speech, but, in some degree, more faintly characterized. Let
those tones which denote any disagreeable passion of the mind,
be still more faint than those which indicate agreeable emotions:
and, on all occasions, preserve yourself from
being so far affect-
ed with the subject, as to be unable to proceed through it, in that
easy and masterly manner which has its good effects in this, as
well as in every other art.”
MODULATION.
The great redeeming quality with some readers and speak.
ers whose articulation is, by no means, remarkable for distinct-
ness, and whose enunciation, in many other respects, is faulty,
consists in the agreeable variety and beautiful modulation of the
tones of their voice. Indeed, many a speaker passes with the
multitude for an orator, whose sole dependance for popularity
and favour in his art, rests on the power and melody of his
tones, and the agreeableness of his modulations; for he well
knows, that the great majority of hearers, are better judges of
pleasing sounds, than they are of profound sentiments, and that
they are willing to forego the advantages of the latter, for the
gratifying indulgence of the former. But those who wish to
persuade, to move-to convince the understanding and to affect
the heart, will aim at something higher than merely the dealing
out of harmonious sounds. However these may gratify the ear,
yet on them alone the mind would starve. Harmonious and
agreeable sounds should, therefore, be held by the reader or
speaker, in the subordinate rank which a judicious taste assigns
to ornaments in dress—as the mere appendages, not the body,
of the garment.
An agreeable modulation, and a pleasing variety of intona-
tion, are, however, by no means to be regarded as unworthy of
attention. Their importance has already been illustrated, by
showing, that, with some, they are the very quintessence of
what passes for oratory. This being the case, then, we may
readily conceive their happy effects when employed even by
readers and speakers who are otherwise liberally endowed with
the higher qualities of eloquence,

OF TONES AND MODULATION.
GENERAL RULE.
a
The best general rule that can be given for a skilful man-
agement and modulation of the tones of the voice, is to cultivate
and adopt an agreeable variety, such as we know to be pleasing
to others.
The author is aware that this rule is of too general a char-
acter to be of much utility to those whose taste in elocution is
but a little cultivated, or whose apprehension of what is elegant
or excellent, and of what is otherwise, is not very quick; but,
in the subsequent pages of this work, many definite principles
will be developed, which have a direct bearing upon this
subject.
a
EXERCISES.
The great variety of elevation and depression of tone in
which it is proper to pronounce different kinds of composition,
depends mainly on the sentiments expressed: and there are few
whose conception and taste are so obtuse as not to be regulated,
in their enunciation, in some good degree, by this governing
principle.
The following example from Byron, presents a great variety
of elevation and depression of tone
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell'
Did ye not hear it ?-No; 'twas but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street :
On with the dance! let joy be unconfined ;
No sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet-
But hark !-That heavy sound breaks in once more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!
Arm! Arm! it is-il is—the cannons' opening roar!
Remark.—No one can be at a loss to perceive that the
commencing words of this passage, “hush! hark!" should be
pronounced in a low tone approaching a whisper; and the res
idue of the same line, in a deep, low tone of earnest pathos, a
little higher than the preceding, but not quite so elevated as the
interrogatory which follows it. The line and a half which
a
answer the question, require a light, joyous tone, considerably
elevated above that in which the interrogation is expressed. In
the phrase, "On with the dance !" the voice breaks forth with
a sudden abruptness, and in quite an elevated tone; but falls a
little, again, on the two and a half lines which follow. And
again the voice falls

greatly again, and successively, on each of the words “nearer,

clearer, deadlier;" until, as it approaches the word “ Arm!”
it breaks forth in its most energetick, impassioned, and highest
strain.
In general, the tones and modulations of the voice, except
when influenced by the principles of inflection and emphasis,
are to be regulated by an exercise of good taste, which may
ordinarily be acquired by an attentive observance of the man-
ner adopted by those who excel in elocution, and by private ap-
plication.

Errours in regard to Pitch and Tones.
High Pitch.-As it regards the tones of the voice, there is
not, perhaps, a more common or unbecoming fault to which
publick readers and speakers are liable, than that of commen-
cing in a loud and vociferous manner. This abrupt and bois-
terous beginning is always displeasing, and not unfrequently
disgusting, to the auditory. It wears the aspect of immodesty
in a speaker, and appears, in general, to proceed from his over-
weening confidence in his own abilities; and, moreover, to a
judicious hearer, it is a fair index, put out to forewarn him, that
he may expect, in what is to follow, neither a display of good
taste nor of talents.
Although the pitch and tone of the voice at the opening of a
discourse, are, in some measure, to be governed by the occasion,
or the circumstances under which a reader or a speaker's ora-
torical powers are called forth, yet seldom will circumstances
require him to depart from the general direction given him in
regard to pitch, on page 56, namely, to adopt that pitch of
voice which he generally employs in ordinary conversation.
As this pitch will be found most convenient and easy to him-
self, so will it appear the most natural and agreeable to his
6

hearers —a point by no means to be overlooked. In this pitch,
also, will his tones and inflections of voice be the most natural,
and thus enable him to give them the greatest and most grate-
ful variety of swell and melody.
As a speaker advances in his discourse, especially if it be
somewhat impassioned, and increases in energy and earnest-
ness, a higher and louder tone will naturally steal upon him,
and sometimes he may even change his cal pitch; and in
such cases it may require no little address to keep his voice
within proper bounds. This may easily be done, however,
by occasionally recalling it, as it were, from the extremities
of its adventurous flight, and by directing it to those who are
near him.
Low Pitch. ---An errour more frequent than that last pointed
out, though perhaps not so fatal, occurs with those speakers
who take their key-note or pitch in too low a tone to be dis-
tinctly heard. At the commencement of his discourse, a speaker
may presume much upon the indulgence of his hearers; but
this is no good reason why he should speak so low as to com-
pel them to listen, with the greatest attention, in order to un-
derstand what is delivered. What is worth being uttered at
all, is worth being spoken in a proper manner; but can any
thing be more improper, than to utter our sentiments in so in-
distinct a manner, or in so low a tone, as to render it impossi-
ble for any one clearly to understand what is said ?
This fault, if long continued, is apt to exhaust the patience
of the hearers, who justly consider it an abuse of their good-
nature, and an insult to their understandings. Therefore, in
this, as in all other things, great extremes should be avoided.
Affected Tones. There is not a more besetting, oratorical
sin, into which readers and speakers are apt to fall, than that of
adopting an affected tone of voice. Maný a one who, in ordi-
nary conversation, has nothing peculiar or disagreeable in his
tones and modulations, or, perhaps, whose voice is quite agreea.
ble and melodious, will, nevertheless, when he comes to read
or speak in publick, at once divest himself of the natural tones
of his voice, as he would cast off an old garment that carried
contagion in it, and which he feared would be communicated
to his hearers, and enter upon his labours with a stiff, formal,
artificial, and affected intonation, in which he appears more un-
seemly and disagreeable than he would in a borrowed gar-
ment, even one that was shabby and did not fit him. Some af-
fect a simpering, soft, silly, sweet prettiness of tone and man-
ner; but more, a rigid, pompous dignity or solemnity; both of

which are equally foolish and absurd. A man of correct taste,
however, will put forth his strength in his natural tones, and
be sure, if not to please, at least, not to disgust, his auditory.
Every thing like an academical tone, a scholastick tone, a
clerical tone, or a sectarian or professional tone, should, by him
who would excel in elocution, be carefully avoided. Even a
trilling or tremour of the voice, as it
appears, unless
very
skil-
fully managed, more or less artificial, is to be very sparingao
ly employed. In general, the only safe course for a reader or
a speaker to pursue, is to attempt nothing more with his voice
before a publick audience, than what he already knows, by ex-
perience, to be both 'easy and NATURAL; but, in private, he
ought to be unceasing in his efforts to improve his voice in all
the qualities of inflection, power, volume, compass, tone, and
pitch.
MODULATION.
In regard to modulation, it may be observed, that the varia-
tions of sound which the voice is capable of producing, are al-
most infinite; and that the modulations necessary to produce
even common melody in prose, are very great. These modu-
lations or variations of tone are produced more or less harmo-
niously and appropriately by a reader or a speaker, just in pro-
portion to the perfection and delicacy of structure in his organs
of sound, the cultivation and refinement of his taste, and the
accuracy of his ear. But the defects of most readers and speak-
ers, are no less glaring than frequent. Among these may be
mentioned that of pronouncing two or more words which fol-
low each other in the same construction, with a sameness of
modulation. Except in those rare instances, in which the mon-
otone is proper, no two words in the language, belonging to
the same class, can immediately succeed each other, where a
just elocution does not require that the modulations of tone em-
ployed in pronouncing the one, should be different, at least, in
some slight degree, from those adopted in pronouncing the
other. If, for example, the words "day and hour," in the fol-
lowing lines, were both to be enunciated in precisely the same
tone of voice, how shockingly would the spirit and beauty of
the sentiment be marred!
A day, an hour, of virtuous liberty,
Is worth a whole eternity in bondage.
And yet, strange as it may appear, readers are not wanting,
who are so totally devoid of refinement in taste, as to pronounce,

not only two words in succession, but even three, four, or five,
with scarcely a perceptible variation of tone.
Example:-—"He combined within himself all the elements
of terrour, nerve, malice, and intellect—à heart that never melt-
ed, a hand that never trembled, a mind that never wavered from
its purpose.'
Remarks.—In pronouncing the words terrour, nerve,
malice, and intellect,” the intonation should continually vary
as it passes on from one word to another. In enunciating
* hand,” the modulation should be nearly similar to that given
to “heart;" but the effect of a good elocution would be greatly
injured, were one to pronounce “mind” without a far greater
variation in his tone of voice. Similar directions might be
given for pronouncing the verbs “melted, trembled, and waver-
ed,” as well as the adverb "never," although it would be im-
proper to adopt a uniform variety in enunciating these three
classes of words.
In such instances as these, the leading characteristick in the
change of tone that is proper to be made, consists in an increase
of the force and fulness of volume, as the voice advances from
one word to another. This augmentation of force and energy,
however, must be slight or otherwise, just in proportion to the
nature and spirit of the sentiment expressed. Another feature
of this kind of modulation, is controlled by the inflection of
voice that is proper to be adopted. This subject, therefore, will
be resumed again in those chapters which treat of inflection
and emphasis.
Errours in Modulation.
Monotony.—The monotone may sometimes be advantageous-
ly employed in pronouncing a simile, or some other peculiar
construction of language; but a dull, monotonous method of
pronouncing words in general, is, in the highest degree, repre-
hensible. When the monotone is proper, a reader or a speak.
er of ordinary capacity and acumen, will adopt it naturally, and
without the least artificial effort, just as he would express, by
the modulations and tones of his voice, many of the passions and
emotions, merely by the promptings of internal feeling. If we
would interest those who listen to us, we must adopt a pleasing
and natural variety of tones and modulation : and nothing will
be more sure to produce the opposite effect, than the adoption of
artificial tones, or of a drawling, lifeless monotony.
Artificial Variety.But in order to avoid a monotonous
manner of delivery, many a one falls into an opposite extreme,

equally offensive to a chaste ear, and not less inconsistent with
the principles of correct enunciation. In order to give his words
the greatest possible variety of intonation, inflection, and mod-
ulation, he loses sight of both principle and natural propriety.
He plunges into the depths of artificiality, and soars above the
heights of elegance. He gives you correct tones and incorrect,
agreeable modulations and disagreeable, all blended together,
and displeases more than the dull
, plodding, humdrum monoto-
nist. But this artificial variety, is very apt to settle down into
what is no less intolerable, a
Uniform Variety.—Among tasteless readers and speakers, a
uniform variety assumes as many set forms as Proteus had
shapes; but they are far less pleasing. These artificial and
uniform modes of delivery, are too numerous to admit of an
adequate description : and they too frequently occur not to have
attracted the attention, and have elicited the displeasure, of
most people.
This displeasing and unnatural uniformity occurs with some
speakers who run into the false conceit
, that they must begin
every sentence in the same tone and elevation, or depression, of
the voice, and always close it with the same fall or cadence. A
sameness of tone and modulation, they also adopt at every re-
currence of any particular stop or pause, how different and va-
ried soever the language and sentiments may be. But in poe-
try this characteristick of dulness attains its full growth. Here
we often see this uniform variety carried into a regular tune ;
but it is a tune that shocks every ear but that of the pseudo-
songster.
As these last two faults often arise from an improper appli-
cation of the inflections of the voice, and of emphasis, they will
be more particularly noticed in a subsequent chapter.

CHAPTER III.
INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE.
THE INFLECTIONS of the voice consist in those
peculiar slides which it takes in pronouncing a
letter, a syllable, or a word.
There are two of these slides, the upward and
the downward. They are most apparent in the
pronunciation of emphatick words, and words im-
mediately preceding a pause, especially the clo-
sing pause at the end of a sentence.
The upward slide is called the Rising Inflec-
tion. It is sometimes indicated by the acute ac-
cent, or following mark ().
The downward slide is denominated the Fall-
ing Inflection. It is represented by the grave ac-
cent; thus (').
When both the upward and the downward
slides of the voice occur in pronouncing a syllable,
they are called a Circumflex or Wave.—The Cir-
cumflex is indicated thus ().
CONCRETE SLIDES OR INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE.
Before the learner proceeds to a perusal of the following de-
velopment of the subject under consideration, he is requested to
turn back to page 55, and carefully re-examine what is there
said of the concrete and discrete movements of the voice, and
of the radical, and concrete and discrete pitch, as such an ex-
amination will enable him more readily to comprehend the
illustration which follows.

manner, the letter y, (which is a diphthong,) the unpractised

heard in 00-ze, which sound rapidly slides into that of i, and
then advances to that of ee as heard in e-ve, and on which it
gradually passes off into silence.
But, at present, the attention of the student is particularly
called to the lessening vanish of the voice as it dies away into
silence at the close of a sound. A few experiments, therefore,
on some of the vowel elements, such as o, a, e, u, or on the
words man, name, joy, song, and the like, may be instructive to
such as have not hitherto given this subject a separate atten-
tion, as it will enable them to perceive two important circum-
stances in regard to the philosophy of vocal sounds, namely,
that in the delicate vanish of the voice at the close of a letter
or word, the stream of sound generally takes either an ascend-
ing or a descending direction, as it dies away into silence, ac-
cording to the impulse given by the organs which explode the
sound, and that a little attention to this vanishing slide, will en-
able any one to ascertain its direction, and thus to distinguish
between what is called the rising and the falling inflections of
the voice. If, in slowly pronouncing the letter y, ż, or 0, for
example, the attention of the learner be directed to the opening
fulness, and the gradually diminishing volume of the voice un.
til it terminates in silence, he will readily perceive the proprie-
ty of Dr. Rush's giving the name of radical movement to the first
part of the elementary sound, and that of vanishing movement
to the second—and, also, that of designating the whole move.
ment which has been described, a vanishing tone. “ This grad-
ually lessening volume of sound upon syllables, and exquisite
vanish with which they terminate, contrasted with their open-
ing fulness, are circumstances which show the superiority of
the human voice over all musical instruments. The full mani.
festation of the radical and vanish in the management of the
slides of long quantity, or, in other words, in the utterance of
long syllables, in speaking, reading, and recitation, is, in the
highest degree, captivating to the ear, and is what gives smooth-
ness and delicacy to the tones of the voice. In short syllables,
the difference of the radical and vanish is perceptible, though
not so obvious.''*
RISING INFLECTION.
In the first place, let the sentence, “I will try to do better,"
be pronounced in a very deliberate manner, but without any
stress being given to the word try; and let the attention be

particularly directed to the sound of y. Then repeat, in the
same deliberate and natural manner, that portion of the sen-
tence which closes with try, without the remaining part of it
with precisely the intonation that would be employed were the
whole sentence to be pronounced, and the letter y will be found
y
"to have the rising slide of a second," or a tone: thus," I will
try-
In the second place, let the following sentence be uttered as
a simple inquiry, or as it naturally would be if the answer yes
or no were expected to it, and the y will take the rising slide
of a third, or, in other words, its lessening vanish will rise
two tones before it terminates: “ Did he
say
he would try—to
do better?
Again, if the question be pronounced under the emotion of
surprise, and with a strong emphasis on the word try, the Y
will have the rising, concrete slide of a fifth; that is, from the
radical portion of its sound to the terminating point of its vanish,
the stream of voice will ascend four tones: “ Did he
say
he
would TRY???
Lastly, if the question be asked under a still stronger excite-
ment of surprise, with a proportionable increase of the emphasis,
the sound of y will stream through the rising octave: “ Did he
Y
say he would TRY?! “Children and women whose emotions
are particularly lively, frequently ask a question with the in-
tense, piercing slide of the octave."
FALLING INFLECTION.
Let the sentence," I saw Mr. Pry," be uttered in a natural
manner, without the least emphasis or expression of emotion
on the last word, and closed with the ordinary fall of the voice
given to simple, affirmative sentences, and the letter y will take
the falling slide of a second: thus, “ I saw Mr. Pry.”
If, in pronouncing the sentence, such a degree of emphasis
be given to the last word as merely to contrast it with the name
of some one understood, it will display the falling slide of a
third: I saw Mr. Pry.
If, in uttering the sentence, we increase the emphasis on Pry
so much as to express an earnest degree of positiveness, the
stream of sound will fall through a concrete fifth : " It was
Mr. PRY-I tell you."
But let the highest degree of dictatorial positiveness be given
to the word as if uttered in anger, and the slide will reach the
downward octave : You provoke me: I said it was Mr. PRY."

ward slides of the voice, the author is mainly indebted to Dr.
Rush's “ Philosophy of the Human Voice,' and to Dr. Bar-

Remarks. --Let the reader who is not in the habit of attend-
ing to the inflections of the voice, pronounce the foregoing sen-
tences deliberately and in a natural tone, and he will readily
perceive, that the voice slides upward in its vanish at the close
of each. If he protract the sound of the last syllable, the pe-
culiar characteristick of the inflection will be rendered still
more obvious.

These exercises are presented mainly for the young tyro in
elocution, as preliminary to the application of the following
rules. Let him, therefore, in the first place, read them several
times over, observing carefully to apply the inflections of the
voice according to the prescribed marks. But in order to en-
force
upon his mind the great importance of a strict attention
to the upward and downward slides of the voice, after having
learned to pronounce these examples correctly, let him reverse
the process: that is, let him make the falling inflection, where
the voice ought to rise, and the rising, where it should fall, and
he will readily perceive, that the performance will be difficult
and unnatural, and, also, that the meaning and the melody of the
sentences will thereby be impaired. This procedure will qualify
him more readily to detect the proper inflections wherever they
occur, as well as more easily to understand the illustrations and
the application of the rules when he comes to enter upon the
succeeding exercises.
It will not
, perhaps, be deemed impertinent to suggest to the
teacher of classes in reading, the importance of frequently re-
quiring several members of the class to pronounce. successively,

the same sentence, and of occasionally causing the whole class
to repeat the same sentence at one and the same time. Such
procedures will prove, not only a saving of much time and la-
bour, by instructing and exercising many at once, but also have
a tendency to excite in their minds a high degree of emulation
—the grand secret of able teaching. Let the instructer first
read each sentence to the pupil in a distinct and eloquent man.
ner, and then require him to pronounce it exactly in the same
manner.
When the following rules are brought before the learner, no
faithful teacher will neglect to explain them clearly, and to en-
force them practically: No faithful instructer will lose sight of
the important maxim, that the juvenile mind ought to be led
along the path of science; not driven. Principles should be de-
veloped; rules, illustrated; intricacies, unfolded; obstacles, re-
moved ; and, indeed, whatever branch of science a youth is pur-
suing, should be made plain, easy, and inviting: From the lips
of an eloquent teacher, instructions drop like honey from the
comb. They flow as clear as the pebbled brook. They fall
like sweet musick on the listening ear.

RULES FOR THE INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE.
RULE I.
A simple, affirmative sentence, or member of a
sentence, generally closes with the falling inflec-
tion; as,
« God is just'.” “Cheerfulness is prefer-
able to mirth'." "Liberal principles are advan-
'
cing rapidly in most parts of the civilized world'.”
EXCEPTION. The inflections of the voice, are sometimes
controlled by emphasis, and are, in such instances, styled em-
phatick inflections, as in the following examples, in which
Rule 1st is reversed: “ It is the dictate of rea-son to yield the
argument to one who commands thirty lê-gions'." "Three thous-
and duc-ats'; 'tis a good', round sûm”.”
"Here', under leave of Brutus and the rest',
(For Brutus is an hôn-ourable mân';
So are they all, all hôm-ourable mến,)
Come I to speak in Cesar's funeral'.”
A thousand of our years amount
Scarce to a dây in thine account'.”
Remarks.—If, in this last example, the emphasis had fallen
on account, instead of thine, the inflection at its close, would
have been reversed, and, therefore, made according to Rule 1.
So, also, in the example which precedes it, were the emphatick
force to fall
upon man
and
men,
instead of honourable, both these
words would close with the falling inflection.
But notwithstanding this exception to Rule 1st, the principle
contained in it, is one of extensive application in reading, and,
moreover, one that will generally be found to be correct. Hence,
we might insist on the importance of the Rule; but its impor.
tance becomes greatly increased when it is considered in its rela-
tion to Rule 2, which forms a contrast with it.
66
RULE II.
A negative sentence, or member, commonly
ends with the rising inflection; as, 6 God is not
the author of sin'." "He can no longer drown the
voice of conscience in the clamorous report of
war."
The novitiate in grammar is informed, that every sentence, or mem-

66
ber of a sentence, which embraces the word no or not, or the affix un,
is called negative.
EXCEPTION 1. When a negative sentence is employed to
answer a question, it generally closes with the falling inflec-
tion; as,
With whom will you abide ? With no one'."
“When will you return? Never.” “Whom did you call ? No-
body.” “Were you pleased with the discourse ? No'; I was
not at all pleased with it.'”.
EXCEPTION 2. Rule 2, is sometimes reversed by the con-
trolling power of emphasis; as, " It was once remarked of a
gentleman in the Irish Parliament', in allusion to his well-
known gor-mandizing propensity', that he had eaten up his
senses' ; to which Henry Erskine replied', 'Pugh'! they would
not be a mouth-ful to him:'"
Remarks.—Were it proper, in this example, to allow the su-
periour emphasis, in an inverted equal wave, to fall on him, in-
stead of mouthful, the inflection at its close, would be the rising,
in accordance with Rule 2d; thus, “ Pugh'! they would not
be a mouth-ful to him'.".
Again, if a friend in entreating me to oblige him in some par-
ticular thing, were to put to me the interrogatory, “ Can you do
it for me?" in case I wished to decline the request in a gentle and
conciliating manner, my reply would be, "No; I can-not'"-
“
with a stress upon can, and the rising inflection upon not; but
were I to reply in a harsh and morose manner, the emphasis
and the inflection, as well as the intonation, would be changed;
thus, “No; I can-not.
ExcePTION 3. Doctrinal precepts and moral maxims, (in
the enunciation of which, emotion, strong emphasis, and intense
inflection, would ordinarily be improper,) though expressed neg-
atively, generally close with the falling concrete when not
contrasted ; as, Bless', and curse not." “Be just', and fear
not'." "Speak evil of no man." " Let no cor-rupt communica-
'
tion proceed out of thy mouth'."
“Thou shalt not kill"." .“ Thou shalt not steal'."" Thou
shalt not bear false witness against thy neigh-bour.""
But when such maxims are contrasted, or expressed with
emotion, they commonly take the rising vanish; as," Mind not
high things"
, but condescend to men of low estate'." "Be not
“
overcome of e-vil', but overcome e-vil with good'."
“I cannot tell what you and oth-er men
Think of this life'; but for my single self,
I had as lief not be', as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I my self"

Remarks. It
may
be observed to the student, that, in the
application of the rules of elocution, discretion must often be his
tutor; but let him not hence infer, that these rules are of little
or no importance to him. When judiciously applied, their
effect will be, not only to correct affected and false modes of
reading, but, by conducting him into the paths of accuracy and
elegance, to enable him to attain original excellences and
beauties.
а
EXERCISES—Rules 1 and 2.
Envy is bound up in the heart of a fool'.
No one is willing to be thought a fool'.
'Tis not in man', who is of yesterday'—who hastens down
to moulder in the dust'—'tis not in man presumptuous to con•
tend with God his Maker'.
A stranger's purpose in these lays',
Is', to congratulate, and not to praise'.
The path of sorrow', and that path alone',
Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown';
No traveller e'er reached that blest abode',
Who found not thorns and briers in his road".
Remarks.--Let the reader, in pronouncing the second and
third of the foregoing examples, or almost any other negative
sentences or members of sentences, close each with the falling
inflection, and he cannot but perceive that their spirit, and their
force, their harmony, and their beauty, will thereby be lost. In
the last couplet, it will be observed, that the two negatives no
and not, are equivalent to an affirmative; therefore the sen-
tence is closed with the falling inflection at“ road,” according
to Rule 1.
This rule is often violated by clever readers, by celebrated
divines, and renowned statesmen. The young student cannot,
therefore, be too particular in his attention to it. Some readers
would close the first of the following examples, with the rising
slide; but, as the two negatives, not and un, by destroying one
another, are equivalent to an affirmative', the sentence more
naturally takes the falling inflection. It is sometimes, how-
ever, a mere matter of taste,, whether à rule, or its exception,
be followed.
EXERCISES—Rules 1 and 2, and Notes.

Remarks.—Those negative sentences and members which
take the falling slide, in the last two of the foregoing exam-
ples, are inflected according to Exceptions 1 and 2. The neg-
ative members in the two examples next preceding those last-
mentioned, are inflected according to Rule 2, and the last part
of Exception 3.
In uttering the same sentences on different occasions, (as il-
lustrated under Exception 2,) we change the inflections of the
voice according to the various impressions which we wish to
make, or the sentiments we wish to convey; for, under differ-
ent circumstances, on account of the barrenness of language,
the same words are employed as the vehicle of thoughts, pas-
sions, and feelings widely different: and, in oral discourse, this
diversity in the purport of our words, is always indicated by the
particular tores, modulations, emphases, and inflections adopted

a
Our ability thus to make a few words answer many purposes,
may be regarded as a wise provision of nature. Were it not
for this power of the vocal organs, by which they are enabled
to modulate, and diversify, and vary the sounds of which the
same words are the representatives—were we compelled to em-
ploy a different word for every variation of the same idea, or
sentiment, or feeling, in order to express the innumerable shades,
and changes, and aspects of our thoughts, passions, and emo-
tions, we should be obliged to increase the number of our words
to so vast an extent that it would entirely overreach the powers
of
memory to grasp
it.
The foregoing development of the subject, must have con-
vinced the reader that the study of elocution is not unattended
with difficulties, and that the happy application of its principles,
requires no small degree of the exercise of his reasoning facul-
ties; but, with him who has a large development of the organs
of firmness and combativeness, joined to an active temperament,
difficulties and obstacles, so far from discouraging him, tend
only to arouse the energies of his mind, and excite them to vig-
orous and healthy action. His first inquiry is, whether the
subject is important—whether it is connected with the orna-
mental, the elegant, the useful; and, when satisfied that it is,
his perseverance soon removes all difficulties, and surmounts
all obstacles.
It
proper, nevertheless, to caution the learner against
the misapplication, of rules and principles. These are design-
ed to correct his errours—to lead him back to the simplicity of
nature-to point out to him her paths, and conduct him safely
and smoothly along in them. If
, therefore, in attempting to
enunciate a word, a phrase, or a sentence, according to the
direction of some particular rule, the learner find that his elo-
cution is unnatural, he must reject that mode, and conclude
that, either the rule is wrong, (which will not often be the
case) or that he has misapprehended or misapplied it
. But
let him not stop here. A failure does no positive good. No;
let him persevere, until he finds out a more natural method of
applying the rule.
RULE III.
Sentences beginning with an interrogative pro-
noun or adverb, (who, which, what, how, when,
where, &c.,) generally close with the falling inflec-
tion; as, “Who approaches' ?" "How can I assist

EXCEPTION. In colloquial style, when a remark or state-
ment is not clearly understood by the person addressed, if a
question be put by him, beginning with an interrogative pro-
noun or adverb, it is generally closed with the rising inflection;
" What did you say' ?" “ Whose name did

tion; as, “ Is he dutiful? ??? « Am I, then, to live be-
yond the grave'?" "Are fleets and armies neces-
sary to a work of love and reconciliation' ???

Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow'?
Has God', thou fool', worked solely for thy good' ?
Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn',
For him as kindly spreads the flow'ry lawn'?
Remark.— The inflection at lawn, in this last example, should
not be the falling, because the last two lines of it, are not a sep-
arate member or question, but merely an adjunct, or interve-
ning phrase, of the main question, which, expressed literally,
would run thus: “ Thou fool'! has God', who feeds the wanton
fawn for thy table', and who as kindly spreads the flowery lawn
for him', worked solely for thy good' for thy joy', thy pastime',
thy attire', thy food' ?
RULE V.
When two questions are connected by the con-
junction or, the first commonly takes the rising,
and the second, the falling, inflection; as, “ Does
he speak rationally', or irrationally! ?".
u Should
we say man', or man' ?” “Does his conduct sup-
port discipline', or destroy it' ???
EXERCISES.
Will the trials of this life continue for ever', or will time
finally dissipate them?
Shall we crown the author of all these publick calamities
with garlands', or shall we wrest from him his ill-deserved au-
thority' ?
To the foregoing rule, there are some exceptions.
EXCEPTION 1. When two questions united by or, begin
with an interrogative pronoun or adverb, we frequently give the
falling inflection to both; as, “ How can a blind man see', or
one of no understanding', comprehend' ?". "How shall the
“
weak man wrest the spoil from the strong, or an honest man
deceive his neighbour' ??? " To whom', then', will ye
liken God',
or what likeness will ye compare unto him' ?''
EXCEPTION 2. When two questions connected by cr, com-
mence with a verb, we sometimes close each of them with the

rising inflection; as, “ Canst thou draw out leviathan with a
hook', or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down' ???
“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons', or his head with
spears' ?!!
EXCEPTION 3. When two questions united by or, commence,
the one with an adverb or pronoun, and the other with a verb,
each requires the inflection it would take when not thus con-
nected; as, " Hath the rain a father'? or who hath begotten the
drops of dew?"
EXERCISES—Exceptions 1 and 2.

Remarks.— A little attention will convince any one, that, to
close the last member of these examples with an inflection op-
posite to that which comes before or, would totally pervert the
He will also observe, that, in these examples which
form exceptions to Rule 5, the antithesis in the two members

Remarks.-In enunciating the foregoing examples, the reader
has a fine opportunity to display his skill in modulation.
the first place, let him enter deeply into the meaning and spirit
of his author; and, secondly, let him remember, that, whenever
several successive members are inflected alike, it would be mo-
notonous and insipid to modulate any two of them in the same
manner. In reading such sentences, the voice should gradu.
ally increase in energy and fülness as it advances from one
member to another, and continually vary in its intonation, so
as to produce a sort of climax.
At the words “minor," " then," “ improving," "touched it,"
?
"in it," “enlivened it,” and “shade of hair," a slight pause
(called a Rhetorical Pause) is absolutely necessary to a happy
and forcible elocution. The same kind of pause also occurs
after the words “ His part," "land," ocean," "power," " fame,".
“ riches," " itself," "Conquerors," "Belief," " reason," and
“
“ Or," Or," Or," in the following exercises.
138.- For an explanation of the Final Pause at " under-
take” and “call,” in the example immediately preceding these
Remarks, see page 144.
Exception 1. When a sentence consists of only two affirm-
ative members, the first generally takes the falling inflection
if it end with an emphatick word; as, “ His part was invented
by himself, and was terribly unique!" "He would have en-
slaved the land to make the ocean free'; and he wanted only
power to enslave both!" The idol of to-day', pushes the
hero of yesterday out of recollection'; and will', in turn', be
supplanted by his successors of to-morrow.”

a
of a sentence, is suspended, and depends for its completion on
a succeeding member, such incomplete member or members
generally require the rising inflection--and the suspending
pause; as, “As we cannot discern the shadow moving along
the dial-plate', so the advances we make in knowledge', are
perceivable only by the distance gone over!" "If thy brother
'.
offend thee', thou shalt forgive him.”
But the principle contained in this exception, though gener-
ally correct, and, so far, very important to the oratorical stu-
dent, is sometimes reversed by the controlling power of empha-
sis; as is illustrated by the following examples:-—“One who
frequently associates with the vile', though he may not become
actually base', is sure to gain an ill name'.” “ The man who
is in the daily habit of using ardent spirits', if he do not become
a drunkard', is in danger of losing his health and character.!!
EXERCISES—Exceptions 1 and 2.
As the pupil reads the examples in the following, and other, exer-
cises, he ought to be interrogated by the teacher, in regard to the appli.
cation of the Rules and Exceptions for inflecting, and thus be enabled
to commit the Rules to memory by applying them in practice.
Out of the nettle danger', we pluck the flower thistle'.
As in water face answereth to face', so doth the heart of man

As fame is but breath', as riches are transitory', and as life
itself is uncertain', it becomes us to seek a better portion'

If riches corrupt thee', thy virtue is blasted".
Thy virtue is blasted', if riches corrupt thee'.
Whatever tends to promote the principles of virtue', and
strengthen the bands of brotherhood' --whatever tends to calm
the ruffled feelings', and regulate the passions', is undoubtedly

Franklin', the sage whom both worlds claim as their own',

Conquerors are a species of beings between good kings and

The weakness of mankind', causes them to look with admi-

Belief is an act of reason; and', therefore', superiour rea-
son often dictates to the weak'.
If we have no regard for religion in youth', we seldom have
any respect for it in age'.
Remark.-In this last example, that we have no regard
for religion in youth," is entirely supposititious; but in the fol-
lowing construction, that fact is conceded, and the inflections of
both members are reversed.
If we have no regard for religion in youth, we ought to have
some respect for it in age'.
This demonstrates the necessity of a constant exercise of
good judgment and correct taste, in order to make the proper
inflections.
Example.—The solicitude about the grave', may be but the
offspring of an overwrought sensibility, but human nature is
made up of foibles, and prejudices'.
Remark.--If, in reading this sentence, the superiour em-
phasis be allowed to fall on made up, and the inferiour, with a
circumflex, upon “foibles and prejudices," the sentence will
close with the rising inflection, in accordance with the Excep-
tion to Rule 1.

Remarks. For the sake of a more pleasing variety in mod-
ulation, it would be no unwarrantable liberty to depart so far
from the rule for inflecting this last example, as to give the
falling concrete to the words “tomb” and “roar.”
Many more rules for regulating the various inflections of
the voice, might easily be given; but an unreasonable multi-
plicity of rules on this, or any other, subject, tends to embar-
rass and perplex the learner, and, in a measure, defeat the ob-
ject secured by a less number, judiciously selected and arranged.
Notwithstanding that the happy application of the foregoing
rules, requires no small degree of judgment and taste, both on
account of their liability to be misconceived, and in consequence
of the numerous exceptions (besides those already pointed out)
which ought to be, and which, without detriment to a good
elocution, might be, made to them, it is believed, that a careful
observance of them will prove highly beneficial to such as are
anxious to attain an elegant and an accurate style in reading
and speaking.
In elocution, as in every other department of science which
pertains to ianguage, there are not wanting, at least, a few,
leading, fired principles, which may be lail down as landmarks
in the form of rules, and prove highly serviceable to the novi-
tiate, to guide him on his way to excellence in this department
of learning: but because rules have their exceptions, it is no
good reason why they should be rejected. There are few rules
in any science (except the exact sciences) which have not their
exceptions. Therefore, to reject them, on this ground, would be to
do away all science. But an unnecessary and an unreasonable
multiplicity of rules, is an opposite extreme, equally to be avoided.

The following rules being deemed of minor importance, and
admitting, also, of a greater number of exceptions than the fore-
going, it has been thought most appropriate to present them in
the form of NOTES.
A SERIES.
A SERIES denotes a succession of similar or op-
a
posite particulars, words, or portions of a sen-
tence, following each other in the same construc-
tion. A series may be single, double, triple, or
compound. It most frequently occurs either at
the commencement, or at the close, of a compound
sentence.
By Mr. Walker, the various kinds of series are
reduced to three general divisions :
1. The SIMPLE SERIES.
2. The COMPOUND SERIES.
3. The SERIES OF SERIES.
In the delivery of almost every separate portion of a sentence,
a chaste and an appropriate elocution requires, that the tones
and the inflections of the voice should be varied; but far more
necessary is this variation where the sentence is so constructed
that perfectly similar portions succeed each other to a consid-
erable extent. To attempt to lay down rules by which to reg.
ulate the voice in all its appropriate modulations and inflec-
tions by which to mark the definite character of every tone,
the exact direction of every wave or concrete vanish, or the
precise extent of every upward and downward slide, would be
worse than idle; for such directions, as far as they would pro-
duce any effect, would prove highly pernicious, as they would
lead to a stiff, formal, artificial enunciation-an enunciation the
most execrable that scholastick dulness could invent. But not.
withstanding the absurdity of such an extreme as the one hero
alluded to, something may be effected by the observance of a

ESSAY ON ELOCUTIOX.
few rules judiciously arranged and cautiously applied, by their
pointing out the most harmonious and agreeable variety that
may be adopted in the enunciation of the different kinds of se-
ries. If they merely prevent that tasteless and unendurable
monotonous manner so often exhibited in the pronunciation of
such constructions, they effect, not merely a negative, but a pos-
itive, good.
SIMPLE SERIES.
A SIMPLE SERIES consists of two or more sin-
gle words or particulars, following each other in
the same construction, either in commencing or
in closing a sentence.
NOTE 1. When a sentence commences with two particulars,
the first may have the falling, and the second, the rising, in-
fection. Example : “Exercise and temperance' strengthen
the constitution."
Observation 1. It has already been shown, that the upward
and the downward slides of the voice vary very greatly in de-
gree or extent. Care should be taken in reading the foregoing
example, that the downward slide on the word exercise, be but
slight—not more than one tone, or the falling slide of a second.
Obs. 2. In Mr. Walker's zeal to build
ир,
and
support, a the.
ory, possibly it never occurred to him, that neither the forego.
ing, nor the following, rules, are grounded in the philosophy
of language, nor on the philosophical principles of vocal sounds,
but merely on the ideal principles of good taste. Very well.
But may not the principles of good taste, vary? Unquestiona-
bly they may:* and with every variation of these principles,
the rules that are founded on them, must, of necessity, undergo
a corresponding change. Hence, it would be no particular det-
riment to the elocution of the foregoing example, were we to
give the rising inflection to both of the commencing particulars;
for a pleasing variety (which a just elocution absolutely de-
mands) may be given to their enunciation merely by modula-
a
*
Possibly the fastidiously critical in the use of terms, will take exceptions to this
remark. But without wishing to provoke criticism, or to start the supposition that he
is willing 10 handle words loosely, the author begs leave to remark, that all he means
by the phrase, “the principles of good taste may vary,” is, perhaps, expressed in the
phrase, good taste may vary.” This last proposition, however, he maintains to be
true: and its correctness, he believes, is fully established by some of the illustrations
which follow One man may enunciate a series, sentence, or passage, in a masterly
and an elegant manner, and another may pronounce the same in a iranner equally
elegant and chaste, though in a style widely different from the first; and at the same
time, it might defy all the laws of philosophy, of rhetorick, and elocution, to prode
which of the two has the advantage in elegance and accuracy of taste,

а
a
tion and expression, or, in other words, by varying the tone and
force of the voice, as it passes from one word to the other, with-
out perceptibly varying the inflection: thus, " Exercise and
temperance' strengthen the constitution."
It may be proper to add, however, that the rule is useful, as
its observance will be sure to enforce a variety in the enuncia-
tion of the two words, which, without it, might be pronounced
in a disagreeable monotone : and, furthermore, its direction will
suggest a very pleasing and natural variety, perhaps the best
that can be given.
Note 2. When a sentence closes with two single particu-
lars, the first takes the rising, and the second, the falling, inflec-
tion: Eg: “The constitution is strengthened by exercise' and
temperance."
Observation. As it is necessary that this sentence should
close with the falling inflection, or with that peculiar, falling
vanish called a cadence, the principles of melody require, that
the voice should rise on the last word but one of the closing
series. Hence, this rule is based upon a principle of vocal
utterance, and cannot be set aside by any notion of arbi-
trary taste.
NOTE 3. When three single particulars occur at the com-
mencement of a sentence, the first and second may take the fall.
ing, and the third, the rising, inflection: Eg. “Manufactures',
trade, and agriculture', employ the greater portion of the hu-
man species.
Obs. Here it may be observed, again, that, although the
three words, “ manufactures, trade, and agriculture," ought not
to have the same inflection of voice given to each, yet, whether
the rising inflection should be given to the first, and the falling,
to the second, or, vice versa, or whether they should be inflect-
ed according to the directions of the rule, is a mere matter of
taste. This may appear more obvious by reading the sentence
successively, in the three following, different ways:
· Manufactures', trade', and agriculture', employ the greater
portion of the human species :
Manufactures"
, trade', and agriculture', employ the greater
portion of the human species :"
Manufactures', trade', and agriculture', employ the greater
portion of the human species.”
It may be proper to observe, however, in regard to the second
of these readings, that, as the words "trade and agriculture,"
sake the same inflection, it becomes the more important that the
ܙ

8*

ESSAY ON ELOCUTION.
modulation given to each, should be varied, the one from the
other.
NOTE 4. When three single particulars occur at the close
of a sentence, the first and third may take the falling, and the
second, the rising, inflection : Eg: "Whatever obscurities may
involve religious tenets, the essence of true piety consists in hu-
mility', love', and devotion'.''
Obs. It may be useful again to caution the learner against
the very common, but not very tolerable, errour of giving the
voice too intense a downward slide on ordinary, unemphatick
words which take the falling inflection. The purport and the
propriety of this caution will appear more obvious to the unprac-
tised student, if
, in pronouncing the foregoing example, he be
particular to observe, that a correct enunciation allows his voice
to slide only half as low on the word " humility,” (if he give it
the falling inflection; which is by no means necessary,) as on
the word “ devotion," where the voice takes the intense, down-
ward slide of a third, which belongs to the cadence.
Note 5. When four single words form a commencing se-
ries, the first and fourth may take the rising, and the second and
third, the falling, inflection: Eg" Metals', minerals', plants,
.
,
and meteors', contain a thousand curious properties which are
as engaging to the fancy as to the reason.
Proofs of the immortality of the soul may justly be drawn
from the nature of the Supreme Being, whose justice', good-
ness', wisdom', and veracity', are all concerned in this great
point.”
Note 6. When four single words form a concluding series,
the first and fourth may have the falling, and the second and
third, the rising, inflection: Eg. "The four elements of which,
according to the old philosophers, the material world is com-
posed, consist of fire', water', air', and earth'."
He who resigns the world, has no temptation to envy', ha-
tred', malice', anger, but is in constant possession of a serene
mind; he who follows the pleasures of it, which are in their
very nature disappointing, is in constant search of care', solici-
tude', remorse', and confusion'."
Obs. It will readily be perceived, that similar observations
may be applied to Rules 5 and 6, to those which were made in
reference to the rules that precede them. Indeed, as the num-
ber of particulars under these last two rules, is increased, so may
the variety of inflections applicable to the particulars, be pro-
portionately increased. It should be observed, however, that
whatever may be the number of particulars in a simple series,

a

the last one in a commencing series, always requires the rising
inflection, and the last in a closing series, if in a common affirm-
ative sentence, the falling inflection.
NOTE 7. When a long list of single words, forms a com-
mencing series, they may be divided from the right into periods
or groups of three words each: the last period may be read ac-
cording to the direction of Rule 3, and the others, according to
Rule 4, and the odd particulars, agreeably to Rule 1. Eg.
Gold', silver', copper, iron', and lead', are abundant in various
parts of the western continent.”
"Cotton', coffee', sugar', rum', molasses', spices, fruits, and
drugs', are the common products of the West-Indies.”
Love', joy', peace', long-suffering', gentleness', goodness',
faith', meekness', temperance', are the fruits of the spirit; and
against such things there is no law.”
NOTE 8. When a long list of particulars forms a concluding
series, a similar division into periods may be applied to them,
and each period may be read according to Rule 4, and odd par-
ticulars, agreeably to Rule 1: Eg.." The science of elocution
is noble', refined', elegant', pleasing', and useful', intricate', phil-
osophical', and wonderful";" [but some of these rules are fool-
ish', trifling', and unimportant'.)
“The fruits of the spirit are love, joy', peace, long-suffering,
gentleness', goodness, faith', meekness', temperance': against
these there is no law."
66
។
7
COMPOUND SERIES.
A COMPOUND SERIES consists of two or more
phrases or distinct members of a sentence, suc-
ceeding each other in a similar construction.
NOTE 1. When two or more phrases or members form a :
commencing, compound series, the last takes the rising inflec-
tion, and all the rest, the falling. Eg. " To advise the ignorant',
relieve the needy', comfort the afflicted', are duties that fall in
our way almost every day of our lives."
"The ignorance of the moderns', the scribblers of the age,
and the decay of poetry', are the topicks of detraction with
which a bard of our country makes his entrance into the
world"
Note 2. When two or more members form a closing, com-
pound series, they all adopt the falling inflection, except the
penultimate or last member but one, and this should have the

rising: Eg. “Statues can last but a few thousand years', edifices
fewer', and colours still fewer than edifices'."
A discreet and virtuous friend relieves the mind', improves
the understanding', engenders new thoughts', awakens good res-
olutions', and furnishes employment for the most vacant hours in
life.”
Observation. This last Note is an important one; but this,
the substance of the one preceding it, and of several others
which occur under the head of the Simple Series, are compre-
hended in Rule 7, page 82.
SERIES OF SERIES.
The recurrence of two or more simple particu-
lars, combined with two or more compound par-
ticulars, and all united in forming a series of a
sentence, constitute what is termed a SERIES OF
SERIES.
Note. When several members occur which are composed
of similar or opposite particulars, and are divided into couplets
or triplets, they may be enunciated singly according to the ap-
propriate rules of a simple series, but, as forming a whole com-
pound series, agreeably to the rules applicable to the respective
number and variety of compound particulars contained in the
sentence.
EXAMPLES.

" Those evil spirits who, by long custom, have contracted in

REMARKS.
This scheme of Mr. Walker's for arranging and classifying
the various series of words, and of applying to them a syste-
matick set of rules, certainly displays no little ingenuity, and
cannot but be productive of some utility; but it is by no means
a cause of regret to ascertain, on an examination of it, that

most parts of it have no better foundation than the vivid fancy
and delicate taste of its inventor. Nature would have dealt
out her favours with a parsimonious hand indeed, had she al-
lowed the human voice no greater scope in inflecting the mul-
tifarious and insurpassable variety of forms of expression, and
modes of intonation, which occur in our language, than that
prescribed by Mr. Walker's rules.
But notwithstanding we may take great liberties with many
of the foregoing rules which attempt to regulate the inflections
proper to be given to a simple series of words, it must have
been observed by the judicious reader of the preceding, general
development of this intricate and delicate subject, that many of
the rules given for the regulation of the inflections of the voice
—such, for example, as those which appertain to the closing in-
flection of simple affirmative, negative, interrogative, and ex-
clamatory sentences, as well as of declarative and conditional
members of sentences, and so forth—have theïr foundation in
the philosophy of vocal sounds and the principles of the lan-
guage; and that, therefore, the laws which govern such inflec-
tions, are as unchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Per-
sians. Some of these rules, it is true, have their exceptions;
but even these exceptions are controlled by principles and cir-
cumstances that are easily revealed and explained. The amount
of the matter is, then, that, in whatever light we view this sub-
ject, the leading rules, together with their exceptions, which
tend to regulate the inflections of the voice, merit the particular
attention of him who would excel in the science of elocution.
But their great importance may be more strongly enforced by
adducing a few examples in which it will appear, that a wrong
inflection will totally pervert the sense.

CIRCUMFLEX.
On page 67, the reader was informed, that,
When both the upward and the downward
slides of the voice occur in pronouncing a sylla-
ble, they are denominated a Circumflex or Wave.
It is represented by the following mark (), which
is commonly placed over a vowel; thus (à).
The upward and the downward slides of the voice some
times extend to three or four variations on the same syllable;
for which reason Dr. Rush has divided the circumflexes or
waves into single, double, and continued; and subdivided them

again into equal, direct, inverted, unequal, direct unequal,
and inverted unequal. Although to the ordinary reader, these
distinctions may be of little importance, yet some may
be grat-
ified with an illustration of them.
SINGLE, DOUBLE, AND CONTINUED WAVE.
When the voice rises and falls, or falls and rises, only once
apon
the same syllable, the movement is called a Single Wave.
When the voice rises and falls, and rises again, or falls and
rises, and falls again, on the same syllable, the movement is
called a Double Wave.
When there are more than three parts to a circumflex, it is
denominated a Continued Wave.
.
EQUAL, DIRECT, INVERTED WAVE, &c.
When the rise and fall of the voice on a syllable, are equal,
the move ent is called an Equal Wave.
When the voice rises first, and then falls, in an equal wave,
the movement is denominated a Direct Equal Wave.
But when it falls first, and then rises, it is called an Inverted
Equal Wave.
When the upward and the downward slides of the voice in a
circumflex movement, are unequal, it is called an Unequal Wave.
When the first part of an unequal circumflex, rises, it is de-
nominated a Direct Unequal Wave.
When the first part of an unequal wave, falls, it is called an
Inverted Unequal Wave.
ILLUSTRATION.
" Hâill beauteous stranger of the wood.”
If the word “hail,” in this sentence, be uttered with a per-
ceptible, downward ending, and with protracted or long quanti-
ty, though without emphasis, the movement of the voice will
display the direct equal wave of a second, or an upward and
downward slide of the voice through one tone.
High on a thrône of rôyal state."
If this line be pronounced in a similar manner, though with
the rising inflection at the close of each word, it will exhibit
the inverted equal wave of a second on the syllables "high,"
" throne," and "roy."
• I said he was my
friend."
Let this sentence be slowly uttered, with long quantity, and
such an emphasis upon "my" as to contrast® it with your-
friend, and the word "my will show the direct equal wave of

a third ; that is, the voice will rise and fall through two
tones.
Ah! is he yoûr friend, then ?"
Let this last sentence be enunciated as a reply to the prece
ding, and with a somewhat brisk air of surprise, though with
long quantity and a natural emphasis upon “your,'' and it will
display the inverted equal wave of a third.
If the sentence, Yes, I said he was my friend,” be reitera.
ted with a strongly positive emphasis upon my, and with ex-
tended quantity, it will exhibit the direct equal wave of a fifth:
or the voice will rise and fall upon the word through three and
a half tones.
"Is he solely your friend ?"
If the utterance of this interrogation be rendered more pier-
cing, with long quantity and increased emphasis of surprise up
on the word you?, it will show the inverted wave of a fifth.
The direci mequal wave will be shown by pronouncing the
word my, in the sentence, “I said he was my friend,” in a
strongly taunting and positive manner.
If, in the sentence, “Is he yoûr friend ??? the word
your

uttered with a strong expression of scorn and interrogation, it
will exhibit the inverted unequal wave.

words “poor” and “old," in the foregoing example, they will
exhibit the direct wave of the semitone : and if the word “man"
receive a plaintive expression and extended quantity, and the
voice be made to rise on the second part of the wave, it will
show the inverted wave of the semitone.

If we are marked to die, we are enough
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
No, no, my lord; wish not a man from England.
If the word " man," in this passage, be uttered with such
an emphasis laid upon it as to contrast it with some antithetical
word understood, but without any circumflex of the voice on
the vowel a, the sense will be perverted, and the inferential
meaning will be, that, although he should not wish a man, yet
he might wish a woman, or a horse : whereas, if the direct
equal wave of a third, with long quantity, be given to the word
"man," the meaning and the beauty of the passage will be fully
displayed.
Example.--Mr. Addison relates an anecdote of an ancient philoso-
pher, who, after having invited some of his friends to dine with him,
was disturbed by a person that came into the room in a passion, and
overturned the dinner table: to which outrage the philosopher calmly
replied, "Every one has his calamity; and he is a happy man that has
no greater than this.
Remark.—This quoted sentence ought to be read with an
easy, free, and perfectly familiar intonation; and then the em-
phatick words, "calamity," "happy and “this," as well as
”
the word “man," will very happily display the circumflex
movements of the voice. In short, the wave of the voice oc-
curs, more or less, in the pronunciation of emphatick words.
This subject will, therefore, be resumed under the head of em-
phatick infections.
Examples in which a wrong Inflection is capable of pervert-
ing the meaning
The curfew tolls', the knell of parting day';
The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea';
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way',
And leaves the world to darkness and to me'.
The author has marked the inflections and pauses in this
passage, agreeably to the elocution which he thinks ought to
be given to it. But who has not observed, that it is commonly
read with the rising inflection and the suspending pause ap-
plied to the word “tolls," in the first line? And who does not
perceive, that such a reading would give the line a totally dif-
ferent meaning from the correct one? It would change the
character of the verb "tolls" from an intransitive to a transitive,
and make the word "knell” an objective case to it, and more-
over, render the line tame, and unpoetical; whereas, nothing
can be more obvious, than that the writer designed the word
9

" knell” to be in apposition with "curfew:" for the last part
of the line, is, literally, a mere repetition of the thought con-
tained in the first part, but, figuratively, it is a new, and pictu-
resque, and glowing image, altogether worthy the talents of the
great poet who conceived it.
Some, again, by confounding the number of lines in this
stanza, with the number of members in the sentence, would
close the second line with the falling inflection, under the mis-
taken notion that the third line is the last member but one, at
the close of which, according to the rule, the voice should take
the rising inflection and the suspending pause. But, when
justly considered, this sentence will be found to be composed of
only three principal members. The first line is a compound
member, the second, a simple, and the third and fourth lines,
form another compound member. From this explanation, then,
and by recollecting that the conjunction and is understood after
the word "lea,” it must appear obvious, that that word should
take the rising inflection, in accordance with Rule 7,
And what chastened ear is there, that does not sanction this ap-
plication of the rule ?
From the foregoing observations, it is evident, moreover, that
a misconception of the structure and character of sentences,
would lead to a misapplication of the rules; and that an inju-
dicious or erroneous use of the rules, would be far more detri.
mental to elocution than no use of them.
One or two more selections from the same beautiful poem,
(Gray's Elegy,) will elicit a few remarks that may be useful
to the unpractised student.

perversion of taste, the falling inflection might be made at the
close of each of the first two lines, yet, were the voice to fall at
the close of the last line of the first verse, as many a reader 18

in the habit of allowing it, the whole passage would thereby
be converted into nonsense.
Some might suppose, that the word "throne," at the close of
the last line but one in the sentence, requires, agreeably to Rule
7, the rising inflection ; but the inflection of that word is con-
trolled by the emphasis that falls upon it; for which reason it
should be inflected according to the 1st Exception to the Rule.
Approach and read' (for thou canst read') the lay'
'Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn'.
This example most strikingly illustrates the importance of
the rising inflection and suspending pause where the sense is
interrupted and suspended, as is the case at the word "read,")
whilst the voice, in an under key, takes its flight through the
parenthetical clause. To allow the voice to fall on the first
read,” is to trample on the laws of common sense, and put
the principles of elocution to the blush.
No farther seek his merits to disclose',
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode',
(There they', alike', in trembling hope repose")
The bosom of his Father and his God'.
It seems to be the most natural to give the falling inflection
to the word “abode," at the close of the second line, in this ex-
ample; but, as the sense, though apparently closed at that word,
is actually interrupted by the parenthetical clause which follows,
the meaning of the last line, in which the word " bosom" is in
apposition with "abode," might, possibly, be as clearly appre-
hended, were we to give the rising inflection to the word
"abode."
The parenthetical clauses in this and the example next pre-
ceding it, seem to call for a remark. In order to render the
meaning, in any tolerable degree, perspicuous, in these two ex-
amples, it is absolutely necessary, that these parenthetical
clauses should be read, not merely in a lower tone or key, but
in an intonation distinctly different in kind from that employed
in pronouncing the other portions of the respective sentences
in which they occur.
The following passage from Addison's Cato, is presented
with the punctuation in which it ordinarily appears in books,
and with the inflections marked in conformity to that punctua-
tion. It is an address of one of the sons of Cato to his brother.
Remember what our father oft has told us',
The ways of Heaven are dark and intricate',
Puzzled in mazes and perplexed with errours';
Our understanding traces them in vain',
Lost and bewildered in the fruitless search',

។
The comma at “intricate," and the semicolon placed after
“errours," very readily cause the reader to mistake the con-
nexion between the members of this passage, and, by making
the rising inflection at “intricate,” to unite the meaning of the
third line with that of the second. A little reflection, however,
will enable him to discover his mistake; for no one would be-
lieve, for a moment, that the great and the just Cato ever in-
culcated into the minds of his sons so irreligious an idea as to
tell them that “The ways of Heaven are puzzled in mazes and
perplexed with errours. Although, to short-sighted mortals,
they may appear“ dark and intricate,” yet, to say that they are
"puzzled in mazes and perplexed with errours," is a profanity
of which neither Mr. Addison nor Cato could have been guilty.
But is not this the meaning of the passage? Agreeably to the
punctuation, most certainly it is. How, then, shall we clear up
the difficulty? Simply by reversing the infections and the
pauses at the end of the second and third line. The meaning
of the third line will then be connected with that of the fourth,
and show the meaning of the poet to be, that it is our
“ under-
standing,” and not “ Heaven,” that is “ Puzzled in mazes and.
perplexed with errours."
The sense and beauty of the passage are restored by punctu.
ating and inflecting it in the following manner:
Remember what our father oft has told us',
The ways of Heaven are dark and intricate';
Puzzled in mazes and perplexed with errours',
Our understanding traces them in vain',
Lost and bewildered in the fruitless search':
Nor sees with how much art the windings run',
Nor where the regular confusion ends'.
The following passage from Henry V. admits of a double
meaning, according to the turn of the inflections:
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me',
Shall be my brother', be he e'er so vile':
This day shall gentle his condition'.
Agreeably to this reading, that is, by giving the rising in-
flection to the word “brother," and the falling to vile," the
conditional phrase, “ be he e'er so vile,” is connected in sense
with the preceding part of the same line in which it occurs;
whereas, by reversing these inflections, according to the direc-
tions in the same passage as subsequently presented, the mean-
ing of the phrase will be connected, as some think it should be,
with the line which follows it.

it is important always to close it with the rising inflection.

CHAPTER IV.
OF FORCE, ACCENT, AND EMPHASIS.
FORCE.
The terms loud and soft, strong and weak, are
employed to express the various degrees of force.
Particular care should be taken not to confound these terms
with high and low. The latter are properly applied to the
tones, or, more accurately, notes, of the voice. A mistake of
this sort, might, therefore, lead one, when he designs to in-
crease the force of his voice, merely to raise it to a higher
pitch; and thus, instead of producing the intended, louder and
stronger sound, he would only give one more shrill.
The term force, as applied to the utterance of syllables and
words, has a meaning distinct from the term loudness, and, also,
from that peculiar stress which is denominated emphasis. Force
is nearly synonymous with energy. Energy in delivery, may
not only be given to single syllables, like accent, and to single
words, like emphasis, but unlike accent and emphasis, it may
be extended to whole sentences, and even to paragraphs.
In regard to a proper loudness of voice, the first object of
every person who reads or speaks to others, doubtless should
be, to make himself easily and distinctly heard by all to whom
he addresses himself. To effect this, he must fill with his
voice the space occupied by the auditory. The volume and
power of voice necessary to fill a given space, depend much on
a proper pitch, as well as on the force and loudness; but far
more, still
, (as heretofore intimated,) on a clear and distinct ar-
ticulation. It is a great mistake to imagine, that in order to be
easily heard, and clearly understood, by those in the remote
parts of a large room, a speaker must raise his voice to a high
pitch. The variety of loudness, softness, energy, and feebleness,
requisite for good delivery, falls within the compass of each
key. A speaker may, therefore, render his voice loud or soft
without altering his key: and by observing a distinct articula.
tion, he will always be able to give the most body-the most
volume of sound—to that pitch of voice to which he is accus-
tomed in ordinary conversation. Whereas, by setting out on a


## p. 106 (#112) ############################################

106
ESSAY ON ELOCUTION.
higher key, he will allow himself less compass, and be likely
to strain his voice before he closes his discourse; and thus, by
• fatiguing himself, he will speak with pain: and " whenever a
person speaks with pain to himself, he is heard with pain by
his audience."
In the exercise of the voice, great economy should be ob-
served in regard to the volume or amount of sound exploded,
particularly by those whose vocal organs are impaired or en-
feebled. One ought, therefore, never to utter a greater quan-
tity of sound (if it is scientifick so to speak) than he can afford
without any extraordinary effort. By keeping within these
bounds, the organs of speech will be able to discharge their
various functions with ease and energy.
Attention to the following direction, will likewise be highly
serviceable. If, before we pronounce a word or phrase which
we wish to express in a very forcible manner, we make a pause,
(generally a rhetorical pause,) and during the pause, draw into
the lungs, a full inspiration, it will enable us to accomplish our
object with great ease and effect.
Our enunciation should be loud or soft, energetick, forcible,
or feeble, according to the nature and design of the word, phrase,
or passage delivered.

ANALYSIS OF FORCE.
The Force or Stress of the voice displayed in the utterance
of syllables, consists of various qualities or characteristicks. It
may be manifested at the commencement of a syllable, by an
abrupt percussion, violently impressing the ear with a sudden
loudness of sound; or it may commence with moderation, and
advance with an increased swell of the voice to the middle of
a

VANISHING FORCE OR STRESS.
the sound or syllable, and then diminish to its close; or the
sound may be particularly marked with force at its termination,
or at both ends, or equally throughout its whole length. To
the suddenness with which a vowel element may be exploded, to
the gradually diminishing volume of voice that may take place
in pronouncing a vowel with extended quantity, and to the final
termination of its sound in a delicate vanish, the attention of
the reader has already been called. In order to gain a clear
understanding of the various kinds of force or stress, some
knowledge of these elements, is indispensably necessary.
RADICAL STRESS.
The term Radical Stress, is given by Dr. Rush to that stress
or sudden force that is frequently applied to the opening or com-
mencing portion of sound given forth in pronouncing a syllable.
Please to read again the illustration of radical and vanish-
ing movement, and so forth, given on pages 25, 56, and 68.
This kind of stress is much employed in expressing the an-
gry passions, and all others associated with them; and, also,
the emotions of hope, joy, exultation, positiveness, and so forth.
Force, when appropriately and effectively employed, is a
symbol of energetick feeling. It gives life and animation to
discourse; and, on many occasions, becomes a powerful agent
The following words of Edward to Warwick, require a high
degree of
Radical Stress.--Guards, seize
This traitor, and convey him to the tower :
There let him learn obedience.
of oratory:
VANISHING FORCE OR STRESS.
As force is often applied at the beginning of a sound, so it is
sometimes given at, or near, the termination of the sliding van-
ish: and when thus applied, it is styled by Dr. Rush, a Van-
ishing Stress.
A striking exhibition of this kind of stress, will be made, it
the student
pronounce a vowel, or a consonant that admits of
quantity, with moderate force, and protract the sound through
the interval of a rising third or fifth, by observing, just at the
termination of the vanishing movement, to give the sound, as
it were, a strong and sudden jerk.
This stress is frequently employed to make the concrete in-
tervals of thirds and fifths in interrogation, more conspicuous,
and is expressive of impatient ardour, surprise, complaint, fret-

fulness, and the like. Hence it is often heard in the complaints
of children, and of peevish persons. It is also distinctly marked
in hiccough, as well as in that peculiarity of the Irish pronun-
ciation of the English language, vulgarly called "Irish accent."
COMPOUND FORCE OR STRESS.
When force is applied at both ends of a sound or syllable, it
is called Compound Stress.
MEDIAN STRESS.
When the sound of a long syllable, swells from its opening
to the middle of it, and then diminishes to its close, the force
applied, is styled by Dr. Rush, Median Stress.
This kind of stress may be illustrated on the words hail,
sole, name, heel, or on y, o, or I, and so forth, in the following
manner :-let the voice open upon these syllables with moderate
force, and gradually swell in volume as it proceeds till it be-
comes full and conspicuous, and then let it diminish in the same
gradual manner until it dies away in the ordinary vanish.
This kind of stress may advantageously be practised on the
direct wave of a second. Words emphasized with it, acquire
an agreeable smoothness of sound. It is the appropriate em.
phasis for syllables of long quantity, and, consequently, is much
employed in all subjects of a dignified character. In the man-
agement of this element, great delicacy is required, for, when
naturally displayed, it is but slightly marked.
ASPIRATE ELEMENTS.
Those consonants called Atonicks, p, t, k, f, s, h, wh, th, and
sh, are denominated Aspirate elements, because they are uttered
by a sort of whispering explosion of the breath, and with little
or no sound in the throat.
Some of the consonants, as well as the vowel elements, are
commonly exploded without any aspiration. It is possible,
however, to mingle aspiration, in various degrees, with all the
vowel sounds; and, indeed, to aspirate them completely by
whispering them.
Aspiration is much employed in expressing scorn, contempt,
excessive anger, earnestness, and the like. What could be
more expressive of scorn than the hissing employed in the
theatre? Aspiration increases the mystery of a passage design-
.edly mysterious, as the following example will illustrate:
Then first, with amazement, fair Imogine found,
That a stranger was placed by her side;

ACCENT.

His air was terrifick; he uttered no sound;
He spoke not, he moved not, he looked not around,
But earnestly gazed on the bride.
ACCENT.
Accent implies that peculiar force or stress of
the voice which is given to a particular letter or
syllable of a word, in order to distinguish it from
the other syllables, and render its articulation
more distinct and audible; as in the word pro-
;
mote, the stress must be laid on the letter
O,
which
gives to the second syllable, mote, the accent.
Every word of more syllables than one, has one of them ac-
cented. With few exceptions, the placing of the accent on one
syllable in preference to another, is determined entirely by
custom.
To promote euphony and distinctness in the utterance of a
long word, a secondary accent is frequently given to one or two
other syllables besides that which takes the principal accent.
The acute accent- (the character employed in this work to
denote the rising inflection of the voice) generally points to the
vowel or syllable which takes the primary or principal accent;
and the grave accent—' (which is employed to denote the fall-
ing inflection) points to the vowel or syllable which takes the
secondary accent: thus, as ion' ish 'ment, tes ti mo' ni .al.
Mere force or stress gives accent to short syllables; as in the
words tem-pest, crim'-inal, hat'-tery.
But the accent given to long syllables, includes not only the
effect of force, but also, the idea of time ; as in the words hope'-
ful, stran-ger, fee'-lingly.
As accent relates to the pronunciation of words, or parts of
words, taken singly and separately, it does not legitimately
come within the province of elocution, which has been defined
lo relate chiefly to the pronunciation of words taken succes-
sively and collectively, and considered according to their relative
dependance on each other for sense. The study of elocution
presupposes, on the part of the student, a knowledge of ac-
cent, as well as of orthography, and so forth. This subject,
therefore, will be closed, by noticing two or three circumstances
under which the accent of words is controlled by secondary
causes, and thereby transposed.
First, a change in the meaning of a word, sometimes changes
10

the place of its accent; as, con jure, to practise enchantments;
con jure', to entreat ;-des'-ert, a wilderness ; de sert', merit or
demerit.
Secondly, the place of the accent is sometimes changed by
the change of the word from one part of speech to another.
The nouns min'ute and com'pact, become mi nute' and com-
pact when employed as adjectives. The nouns abʻstract, com'-
pound, con'duct, di gest, ex'tract, in'sult, ob'ject, reb'el, and so
forth, change their accent when employed as verbs; thus, ab-
stract', com pound', con duct', di gest', ex tract', in sult', object,
Thirdly, accent is sometimes deposed by its rival sister em-
phasis; as in the following examples, in which the former has
to give place to the latter. In these and similar examples, the
words in which the accent is transposed, have, it will be noti-
ced, a partial similarity of form, and are used antithetically.

EMPHASIS.
By EMPHASIS is meant that still more forcible
stress of the voice which is given to syllables, in
order to distinguish the words to which they be-
long from others in the same sentence, than that
stress which is denominated accent.
Emphasis, in order to distinguish it from the less forcible
stress which falls on single letters or syllables, called accent, is
generally defined to be a forcible stress laid on words; but the
following illustrations will show, that the peculiar percussion of
the voice which goes by the name of emphasis, is generally
given, like that called accent, not to several successive syllables
of the same word, but to only one syllable. Its effect, however,
when properly applied, is to render more significant and im-
pressive the words to which such syllables belong, than are the
other words of the sentence.
Although every one knows what is meant by emphasis, ac-
cording to the common acceptation of the term, yet few possess
that nice discrimination, that clear conception of an author's
meaning, and that sound judgment, which are requisite in order
to distinguish emphatical words from others, and to give each
just such a degree and quality of force as will convey
the mean-
ing of what is uttered, in the most lively and striking manner.
A few plain directions, therefore, which are calculated to assist
the learner on these important points, will now be given: and
first, in order to enable him readily to distinguish emphatical
from unemphatical words, the following rules, if carried out in
practice with discrimination, will be found far more serviceable
than
any
others that can be formed.
I. Emphasis is sometimes divided into the three
following kinds, ANTITHETICK EMPHASIS, EMPHASIS
OF SPECIFICATION, and EMPHASIS OF ENUMERATION.*
* Professor Goodrich.

ESSAY ON ELOCUTION.
ANTITHETICK EMPHASIS.
RULE I.
Almost every emphatick word may be known
by its being contrasted, that is, used antithetically,
with some other word or phrase, either ex-
pressed or implied.
EXAMPLES.
Many persons mistake the love, for the prac-tice, of virtue.
We ask ad-vice, but we mean appro-ba-tion,
Sir, you were paid to fight against Alexander, not to rail at
him.
He that cannot bear a jest, should not make one.
I that denied thee gold, will give my heart.
'Tis with our judg-ments, as our watch-es; none
Gojust a-like, yet each believes his own.
Remarks. These examples clearly illustrate both the utility
and the easy application of the foregoing Rule. The italicised
words or portions of words, show, that, when both parts of the
antithesis are expressed, it requires but little discrimination to
ascertain, for a certainty, to which words the emphatick force
should be applied. Very often, however, it happens (as will
soon be shown) that one part of the antithesis is understood, in
which case it frequently requires no inccnsiderable exercise of
judgment to ascertain the emphatick word.
Many mistake the emphatick word or words of a sentence
by labouring to distinguish it or them from others, upon the
false principle of laying the stress on such words as they con-
ceive to be the most important in regard to meaning. A little
examination of the foregoing, or, more especially, of the follow-
ing, examples, will convince any one, that any such test of dis-
crimination between emphatical and unemphatical words, will
generally prove unavailing; for the emphalick words are often
(apparently, or abstractly or separately considered) the least
consequential words in the sentence.
EXAMPLES.
One should be careful not to apply and, instead of or.

well knew he could not

ANTITHETICK EMPHASIS.
-
There is a difference between giv-ing and for-giving, bo-
tween sen-sibility and ir-ritability.
Jesus saith unto her, Where are thine accusers ? · Hath no
man condemned thee? The woman answered, No man, Lord.
Remarks. These examples are sufficient to show, that any
word may become emphatick, and even take a strong emphasis
,
when employed antithetically with another word. The reason
of this must be obvious to him who considers, that this very
circumstance of a word's being employed antithetically, renders
it important in the sentence in which it thus appears: and that,
therefore, it requires that distinction which emphatick force is
designed to give it.
In the following examples, one part of the antithesis is im-
plied.
EXAMPLES.
Exercise and temperance strengthen an indifferent constitu-
tion, (as well as a good one.)
1 speak in the spirit of British law; (and not merely accord-
ing to the dictates of reason.)
In thy sight, O Lord, shall no man be justified: (although,
in the sight of men, many may be justified.]
Proclaim it, Westmoreland, throughout my host,
That he who hath no stomach for this fight,
May straight de-part : his passport shall be made,
And crowns for convoy put into his purse.
We would not die in that man's company.
Remarks.—A corresponding, antithetical member to this
last line, may be supplied in the following, or some other, man-
ner: We would not die in that man's company; much less
would we fight in it.” Or, perhaps the antithesis will be ren-
dered stronger, if constructed in the following manner :
would not only, not fight with a coward, but we would not
even die in his company." But, doubtless, the simplest way
to explain the emphasis on “de-part" and "die," in this exam.
ple, is, by applying the principle contained in Rule 2, on the
next leaf--according to which, it would be styled emphasis of
specification.

Of Iser, rolling rapidly.
But Linden saw an-oth-er sight,
When the drum beat at dead of night.
Remarks. The first sight, antithetically opposed to " another
sight,” mentioned in this last couplet, is described in the second
line of the first stanza: “ All bloodless lay the untrodden snow.”
In the first of the foregoing examples, the word "present"
is contrasted with the implied idea of St. Paul's being then ab-
sent from the Corinthians. His reminding them that he
* wanted” when with them, seems to convey a tacit rebuke for
their lack of liberality towards him, when he was freely devo-
ting his time and labours for the good of their souls. An in-
ferential, antithetical member, therefore, very naturally arises,
somewhat in this manner: I was chargeable to no man when
I wanted, although I had a right to be chargeable to many,
and to have had my reasonable wants supplied."
Example." They brought to the Phar-isees him that afore-
time was blind."
Remark.—By turning to page 214, of this work, the reader
will perceive that the word Phar-isees,” in the passage here
quoted, is contrasted with the word “neigh-bours," which oc-
curs in the preceding paragraph. Again, on the same page,
we have the
Example :-“They say unto the blind man a-gain, What
sayest thou of him?"
Remark.-The Pharisees had al-read-y expressed their
opinion of him.
For numerous examples of emphasis founded on antithesis,
the reader is referred to page 171, 214, and 266, and, indeed,
any of the selections in the latter part of this work in which
the emphatical words are distinguished by Italick characters.
It is worthy of remark, that sometimes one part of the an-
tithesis is a single word, and the other portion, a phrase, or a
member of a sentence, and that sometimes both parts consist of
emphatick phrases or members.

Or to take up arms against a sea of troub-les,
And, by op-po-sing, end them?
Remark. It is not to be understood, that the emphatick
force falls in equal degrees upon every word or syllable here
italicised. Although several emphatick words frequently suc-
ceed each other, yet seldom, if ever, should any two or more
words in succession, receive precisely the same amount or
weight of percussive force, any more than they should receive
the same modulation of tone and inflection. Of the words dis-
tinguished as emphatical, in the last of the preceding examples,
doubtless the first that are contrasted, namely, “Suf-fer" and
"take up arms” require the greatest stress, and “for-tune" and
troub-les,” the least,-
,-a stress so slight, indeed, as scarcely to
raise these to the dignity of emphatical words.
16
EMPHASIS OF SPECIFICATION.
RULE II.
In the specification of particular facts, the prin-
cipal words are always emphatick.
EXAMPLES.
True politeness is based upon sin-cer-ity: it flows from the
heart; is equally fascinating in the cot-tage, the court, and the
camp; and is capable of soft-ening even an en-emy.

ment. Our petitions have been slight-ed; our remonstrances,
have produced ad-di-tional vi-olence and in-sult; our supplica-
tions have been disre-gard-ed; and we have been spurned with
con-tempt from the foot of the throne.
Remarks. In the first of the foregoing examples, antithetick
members might be supplied in the following, or some other,
True politeness is based upon sin-cer-ity, and not
upon pre-tence: it flows from the heart, and not from the
head," and so forth. In the second example, we might say,

pro-tect-ed, I may be per-secuted," and so on. But, as this
method of supplying one part of the antitheses, may appear a
little strained, or far-fetched, it will doubtless be more judicious,
and, certainly, far more easy, to test the emphatick words in
constructions of this description, by the application of Rule 2.
In reading the foregoing examples, the pupil should be very
careful not to pronounce any two successive members with a
monotonous sameness, as that would render his elocution fee-
ble and insipid; but a correct and spirited enunciation of them,
or, at least, of the second and third examples, requires him to
proceed with an increased degree of emphatick force, and a
varied modulation, upon each successive member, so as to pro-
duce a sort of climax.—Similar directions are applicable to the
reading of the following
EXAMPLES.
Alexander.--WHAT! art thou the Thracian rob-ber, of
whose exploits I have heard so much ?
Robber. I am a Thra-cian, and a sol-dier.
Alex. A sol-dier !—a thief, a plyn-derer, an as-sas-sin! the
pest of the country!—I could hon-our thy cour-age; but I
de-test, and must pun-ish, thy crimes.
Robber. What have I done, of which you can complain?
Alex. Hast thou not set at de-fi-ance my au-thor-ity; vi-olated
the publick peace; and passed thy life in in-juring the per-sons
and prop-erty of thy fellow-sub-jects?
Robber. Alexander, I am your cap-tive: I must, therefore,
hear what you please to say, and en-dure whatever punishment
you may choose to in-flict; but my soul is un-con-quered : and
if I reply at all to your reproaches, I will reply like a free
man.
176
Remarks. In these examples, the emphasis on "hon-our,
cour-age, de-test, pun-ish, and crimes,''
“ You,"
hear, say, en-
dure, and in-flict," “ soul, all, and free,” is antithetical; on the
other italicised words, it is emphasis of specification.
You," is contrasted with other men, understood: thus, “I
know that oth-er men may justly reproach me for my
vile deeds;
but what have I done of which such a blood-thirsty tyrant as
you can complain ?"
The last example may be rendered thus : " I know you hold
“
my bod-y in bond-age; but my
soul is un-con-quered."
Remark.—It frequently happens, that several words in suc-
cession, are emphatick, though in different degrees.
Example. I now boldly proclaim it to this house as my

deliberate opinion, that, if that law pass, our country will be
RU-ined: yes, ru-ined for-Ev-er."
EMPHASIS OF ENUMERATION.
RULE III.
Words used in counting or numbering, and, in-
deed, all others, when repeated in a list, or as a
set of examples, are emphatick.
EXAMPLES.
1. The Cardinal Numbers; as, One, two, three, four, five,
twenty, one-hundred, one-thousand, eight-hundred, and thirty-
five, and so on.
2. The Ordinal Numbers : First, second, third, and so forth.
3. Adverbs of Number : Once, twice, thrice.
4. Adverbs of Order: First, secondly, thirdly, lastly.
5. Adverbs of Time: Now, already, before, hereafter, not yet.
6. List of Prepositions: Of, to, for, by, with, in.
7. Descartes, Stahl, Cabanis, and Bichat, Cuvier, Blumen-
bach, Reil, and some others, admit of sensibility without con-
sciousness.
Remarks.-By pronouncing the words in the foregoing ex-
amples, slowly and very distinctly, the reader will perceive that
each requires a degree of percussive force, amounting to what
is termed emphasis.
Emphasis of Enumeration is likewise legitimately employed
in the following, and similar
EXAMPLES.
If one man can do much good, if two men can do more, and
if three can go far beyond two, what may we not expect three-
hundred thousand to accomplish.
In this work, I shall treat of the functions of man as divided,
first, into vegetative, secondly, affective, and thirdly, intellectual.

the affective and intellectual faculties on the brain; in the
fourth, of the plurality of the organs; and in the fifth and last
chapter, of the intellectual faculties and their organs.

Remarks.—In these examples, the emphatick force which

falls upon “much, more, beyond,” “ vegetative, affective, intel-
lectual," sensibility, relation, dependance, plurality, intellect-
ual faculties, organs, and so forth, (though the words are not
marked as emphatick,) may be styled emphasis of specification,
according to Rule 2; and it would not be improper so to style
the emphasis placed upon the marked words, “ one, two, thrée,"'
"first, secondly," " second, third, fifth, last," " fourth, eighth,
twenty-ninth," and so forth; but it is more precise and systemat-
ick to denominate the emphatick force given to these last-men-
tioned words, emphasis of enumeration, according to Rule 3.
Again, though not so simple and easy, yet it would be
neither impossible nor improper to explain the emphasis on
all these words, according to Rule 1, as antithetick: thus, we
might consider “two men” as forming a contrast with "
man,'' “ three men,” with “two,” and so on.
One man can do much ;" “ Two can do
more ;" “ In the first chapter;" and so forth, in the first place,
the words one and tuo specify how many are alluded to, and
first, specifies which chapter: hence, here is emphasis of speci-
fication : and secondly, the phrases, "one man," " two men,"
"the first chapter," and so forth, by specifying the particular
number of men, and the ordinal rank of the chapter, contra-
distinguish that number from any other number of men that
might be supposed or mentioned, and that chapter from any
other chapter, and thus indirectly form an antithesis between
the number expressed, and an imaginary number understood.
“This section is found in chapter fourth, page two-hundred
and eighty-fifth ;" that is, “ It is not found in chapter first,
second, third, or any other chapter, but in chapter fourth; and
on page two-hundred and eighty-fifth, and not on page ninetieth,
one-hundredth, two-hundredth, or any other page that you
might imagine."
“ In the first chapter, I shall speak of sensibility; and not of
consciousness, irritability, or any other property of organick
or animal nature.”
Illustrations of this kind, might be extended; but it is believed
that the good sense of the reader will render farther remarks,
under this head, unnecessary.
For examples of emphasis of specification, the learner is re-
ferred to the words,"friend, ambitious, honourable ; captives,
crown, refuse, know, love, cause, and mourn,"? " parchment, will,
tears, mantle, TELL, mutiny," and so forth, on pages 316 and
317; and, also, to the words, “child, husband, friend, lover,
,
look, word, and action," on page 179. For examples of anti-

317, and to almost any other pages in the second part of this
Mork.
II. Emphasis is sometimes divided into Simple
and Compound.
SIMPLE AND COMPOUND EMPHASIS.
When the emphatick force falls on only one
word in a phrase, it is sometimes called Simple
Emphasis ; but when it falls on more than one
word in succession, it is denominated Compound
Emphasis
EXAMPLES--of Simple Emphasis.
It is as natural to die, as to be born: to an infant, perhaps
the one is as painful as the oth-er.
Let an-oth-er man praise thee, and not thy own mouth.
O that those lips had lan-guage [as well as ex-pres-sion.]
Their vines a shadow to their race shall yield,
And the same hand that sow'-d, shall reap, the field.
EXAMPLES-of Compound Emphasis
Napoleon would have en-slave-d the land to make the o-cean
free; and he wanted only power to enslave both.
It is easier to forgive the weak, who have injured us, than
the pow-erful, whom we have injured.
Ped-antry prides herself on being wrong by rules; while

It has been mentioned, that emphasis, considered in refer.
ence to the different words on which it falls, admits of various
degrees of percussive force, as well as of various qualities in re-
gard to inflection and intonation. This difference in emphatick
force, which, according to their meaning and rhetorical rela-
tions, is demanded by the various, emphatick words of a sen-
tence or discourse, has induced some writers to adopt another
division of emphasis, distinguished by the terms Superiour and
Inferiour. This division of the subject, however, like that of
Simple and Compound, can by no means be regarded as re-
markable for precision or scientifick accuracy; but, as it is con-
sidered by many who have not leisure for scientifick research
and philosophical accuracy, as a convenient distinction, answer.
ing all ordinary, practical purposes, it may be proper to notice it.
SUPERIOUR AND INFERIOUR EMPHASIS.
The term Superiour EMPHASIS is applied to
that stronger percussion of the voice which is
given to some emphatick words than to others, in
order to distinguish it from that less forcible stress
which those others take, and which is thence
called the INFERIOUR EMPHASIS.
EXAMPLE.
I am tor-tured even to Mad-ness, when I THINK
Of the proud vic lor.
In reading this passage, which occurs in Addison's Cato, as
the language in which Marcus expresses his indignation at
the conduct of Cesar, the superiour emphasis falls on " think,"
which word is contrasted with the implied word hear or dis
course : thus, "I am tor-tured even to MAD-ness, not only when
I hear or dis-course of Cesar, but even when I THINK of
him.” A little attention to the passage, will also show, that
the word "madness" requires no very slight degree of percus.
sive force, although a stress inferiour to that given to "think;"
and, likewise, that “tortured," "proud," and " victor," require
each a degree of force still slighter than that laid upon “mad-
ness," but stronger than that which is given to the other words
of the sentence.
Various degrees of emphatick force are also requisite in pro-
nouncing the following sentences, in which the different degrees
are imperfectly shown by the various sizes of type employed,

The distinctive powers and qualities of the voice, described
on pages 107, and 108, under the heads of Radical, Van-

and explained, as applicable in expressing the various degrees
and kinds of emphasis. The reader is therefore requested to
turn again to those pages, and attentively examine the analysis
there given, before he proceeds to a perusal of the following,
scientifick division of this subject. This brief specimen is
chiefly taken from Dr. Barber's Elocution.

EMPHATICK INFLECTIONS.
It has already been hinted, that those words which fall under
an emphatick stress, generally require a peculiar and an ap-
propriate inflection, which inflection, or, most commonly, wave
of the voice, is not unfrequently controlled by the emphasis.
Examples.—Did you say it ? What can I do?
It is easier to sây', than to dô'.
Remarks.--If these questions be pronounced in a natural and
familiar manner, the words “say” and “do,” will take, the first,
the rising, and the second, the falling, concrete slide of a third,
with
very little or no circumflex in the movements of the voice;
but if the second example be properly pronounced, that is, if a
strong emphasis be given to both "say" and "do," with the
rising inflection given to the close of the first, and the falling to
the last, the word “say" will take the inverted unequal wave,
and “ do," the direct unequal wave.
Examples.-Are they He-brews ? So am I'. Are they Is-
raelites'? So am I. Are they the seed of Ab-raham'? So am
I'. Are they the ministers of Chrisť ? I am MORE!
Remarks.-Agreeably to the general rule, the pronoun “ I,”
and the adverb "more," at the close of the four, simple, affirm-
ative sentences here presented, should take the ordinary, falling
inflection; but to give them that inflection, in these instances,
would render the elocution spiritless and insipid. The empha-
sis, on these words, controls their inflections, and requires that
I” should take the inverted unequal wave, which closes with
the rising vanish, and " more," the direct unequal wave. For
the purpose of increasing the harmony of the sentences by in-
troducing a pleasing variety, some might prefer, however, to
give the “ I' in the third sentence, the direct unequal wave.
Examples.---Lord', if thou hadst been here', my brother had
not died".

Remarks. -A correct enunciation of these examples, wil.
show the happy effect of emphasis in controlling the inflec-
tions and modulations of the voice, and of increasing the beauty
and harmony of language. This will be particularly illustra-
ted by a proper application of the circumflex movement on the
words, "died," " pain,” the second “dream,” “ crown," " tears,"
"
“fault,” “sure,” w honourable,” and “man."
The Sense of a passage, dependant on emphasis.
There can be but few who have not observed, that the mean-
ing of a sentence often depends on the appropriate or inappro-
priate application of emphatick force.
Example.—Do you ride to town to-day'? Dou you ride to
"
town to-day'? Do you ride to town to-day'? Do you ride to
town to-day'?
Remarks.—The four different answers 'suggested by a
change in the place of the emphasis, according to the italicised
words in this example, are too familiar to need illustration.
If I say, “He can plead as well as any lawyer," placing
the emphasis on any, the assertion clearly implies, that the
person spoken of, is a lawyer ; but if I transpose the emphat-
ick stress, and say, “ He can plead as well as any law-yer,"
the inferential meaning is, that the person referred to, is not a
lawyer.
Example.--He discourses as religiously as any Methodist
preacher
He discourses as religiously as any Methodist preacher.
He discourses as religiously as any Methodist preach-er'.
Remarks. The first of these readings, implies that the per-
son referred to, is a Methodist preacher ; the second, that he is
a preacher, but not a Methodist preacher; the third, that he is
a Methodist, but not a preacher.
Examples -- A crow is a large black bird'.

Since the world began', has it not been heard', that a mân
opened the
eyes
of one that was born blind'.
Remarks.—By looking at the connexion of this last passage,
as it is presented on page 215, one will readily perceive, that,
according to this last reading of it, that is, by laying the stress
on “man,” it implies, that he who had been restored to sight,
at the time he made this unanswerable reply to the unbeliev-
ing Jews, himself considered Christ to be more than man, and
that he wished to intimate to them this belief; whereas, he was
only attempting to prove to them that Christ was not a sinner,
for he did not yet know who or what Jesus was. Again, a
correct enunciation of this sentence requires the emphatick
stress to fall on “ blind,” on account of which, though the word
closes a negative sentence, it takes the falling inflection, or,
rather, the direct unequal wave, but, by laying the stress on
“man,” we naturally take it off of " blind," and thereby change
its inflection to a rising.
Examples of this description, might be indefinitely multi-
plied; but these few are doubtless sufficient to call the atten-
tion of the learner particularly to this subject, and, it is hoped,
to impress upon him its importance.
The author is not unaware that many will differ from him
on certain points of elocution, particularly those intricate and
delicate ones which regard some of the peculiar inflections and
waves of the voice, (especially when under the influence of
emphatick force,) as well as in regard to the various degrees
and qualities of emphatick stress. It has been already hinted,
that, although most things pertaining to this subject, may be
regulated by fixed principles and rules, yet, on some points, we
have no better standard to go by than good taste—a standard
so loosely seated, that it is liable to be much justled about, ac-
cording to the judgment, and fancy, and caprice of the respec-
tive individuals who lay their hands on it. But the most fruit.
ful ground of objection to the author's views, he apprehends,
will arise out of a misconception of them, or, at least, an un-
skilful or erroneous application of many of his directions.
Doubtless many a one who will take exceptions to his direc-
tions for reading particular words or passages, would readily

This last passage, the sublime and terrible adjuration of Mac-
beth to the witches, is marked agreeably to the direction of Mr.
Walker, as in accordance with the manner of pronouncing it
adopted by the inimitable Garrick, namely, to adopt the falling
inflection at the close of each member except the last but one,
and to give the inflection a degree of emphatick force, increas-
ing in strength from the first member to the sixth. By such
an enunciation, the whole climax will be most beautifully diver-
sified, and its effect greatly heightened.
Before taking leave of this subject
, the author deems it prop-
er to caution the learner against the danger of his attaching
either too much, or too little, importance to the rules laid down
in this work. Of the great advantages resulting from a clear

understanding, and a happy application, of the rules for inflect-
ing, emphasizing, and so forth, in the mind of him who thor-
oughly investigates the subject, there can remain no doubt;
but, should a reader or a speaker rely too much on the formal
application of principles and rules, and suppose that, without
entering deeply into the nature of the sentiments, passions, and
emotions which he attempts to express, these principles alone,
are sufficient to inspire him with eloquence, or even elegance,
in delivery, there is great danger of his being actually tram-
melled by them, and of their producing, instead of a happy, an
exceedingly ill, effect. Emphasis and emphatick inflections
are governed mainly by sentiment, and associated more or less
with passion or emotion. The language of passion is energet-
ick and bold, and requires the reader or speaker to enter with
feeling into the sentiments which he utters. Therefore, in the
application of the rules for inflection and emphasis, this impor-
tant idea should constantly be borne in mind.

OF TIME, AND RHETORICAL PAUSES.
TIME.
The varieties of movement in utterance, are
expressed by the terms long and short, rapid,
precipitate, quick, slow, and moderate.
General Remarks.
A distinct articulation is promoted by a moderate movement
in pronunciation. In general, therefore, this movement is the
best. A due degree of slowness in delivery, by the longer and
more frequent pauses which it allows the reader or the speaker
to make, affords great assistance to his voice, enables him to
swell his sounds with greater force and melody, and gives
weight and dignity to his subject. A rapid pronunciation, on
the contrary, is apt to confound all articulation, and obscure the
meaning
It may not be improper, however, to caution the reader
against the opposite extreme of pronouncing too slowly. A
lifeless, drawling manner, which allows the minds of the hearers
to outspeed the reader or speaker, will inevitably render his
performance insipid and fatiguing. Hence, he who would
seek to please, to persuade, to instruct, must carefully avoid
both extremes, and adopt that variety of movement which the
nature of the sentiment delivered, seems to require. The ef-
fect of an ordinary discourse may be greatly increased, by pro-
nouncing phrases and short passages that will bear it, much
more rapidly than others.

Or where Campania's plain forsaken lies',

Still to my brother turns', with ceaseless pain',
And drags at each remove a lengthening chain'.

Flies o'er th' unbending corn”, and skims along the main'.
There was a sound of revelry by night',
And Belgium's capital had gathered then'

The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men':
A thousand hearts beat happily'; and when'
Musick arose with its voluptuous swell',
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spoke again';
And all went merry as a marriage bell':
Slow—But hush'! hark'! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell'.

Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn',

Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise'.

Celestial states', immortal gods'! give ear';
Hear our de-cree', and rev-erence what you hear'.
As nature delights to indulge herself in variety in all her
works, she has bountifully bestowed this privilege upon man;
and in nothing is it more conspicuously displayed than in the
science of elocution. Here, this “spice of life" grows on every
twig. Here, he is permitted to render even variety itself more
various. Here, by an appropriate modulation of his voice, by
a happy adaptation of its tones and its various degrees of force,
stress, and movement, to the nature of his subject, he rises in
his art to the highest point of excellence.
The foregoing remarks on time, are, perhaps, of too general
a character to please the scientifick reader; but it is apprehend-
ed, that, with most persons, a minute and critical development
of this subject, would be passed by with indifference. Hence,
the former may be of some service, where the latter would prove
unavailing. Although the movements of the voice in reading
and speaking, are susceptible of being as exactly measured as
in singing, and may be strictly regulated by rule, yet the adop-
tion in practice of any set of rules that might be laid down for
this purpose, would necessarily lead to a stiff and formal ex-
actitude in delivery, far less endurable than the most reckless
indifference in regard to time and measure. To readers in

OF TIME:
general, therefore, an exercise of good taste and judgment, in
regard to the varieties of movement proper to be adopted on dif-
ferent occasions, is far more important than all the assistance
they can possibly derive from rules. It requires nothing more
than common observation to perceive, that the proper degrees
of quickness and slowness, no less than of loudness and softness,
highness and lowness, and so forth, are to be regulated by the
quality of the style, and the nature and turn of the sentiments.
Who does not possess acumen enough to know, that
gay
and
animated thoughts, sparkling and lively description, and easy,
flowing narration, require a more accelerated movement than
authoritative, dignified, sublime, grave, or pathetick sentiments ?
QUANTITY.
a
The term QUANTITY, as applied to a letter or a
syllable, is used to denote the time that is occu-
pied in pronouncing it. It is commonly consid-
ered either as long or short
A vowel or a syllable is long, when the accent is on the
vowel; which causes it to be slowly joined in pronunciation
with the letter which follows it; as, Fall, bāle, mõõd, house,
feature.
A syllable is short, when the accent is on the consonant;
which causes the vowel sound quickly to unite with that of the
succeeding letter; as, Bonnět, ånt, hủngěr, pity, ăntick.
It is generally estimated, that a long syllable requires double
the time of a short one in pronouncing it: thus, Māte and note,
should be pronounced as slowly again as măt and not.
The term Quantity, is also sometimes employed to denote,
not only the time, but likewise the amount of volume or ful-
ness of sound, in which syllables, words, and even sentences,
are uttered. But this extended sense of the term includes many
particulars which are treated under the heads of force, modu-
lation, and so forth.
Dr. Rush applies the terms long and short to the time em-
ployed in the utterance of syllables, relatively considered in re-
spect to each other; and the terms quick and slow, he refers to
the utterance of any succession of words considered in the ag-
gregate, such as phrases, sentences, or larger portions of a dis-
course.
The common distinction of syllables into long and short, is
neither definite, nor fully illustrative of their character for the

quantities or times of syllables exhibit various and undistin-
guishable shades of difference, from the shortest, which end
with the abrupt elements, such as pit, ap, to those that allow
the greatest prolongation in oratorical expression, namely, those
ending with a tonick or a subtonick element; such as pay, go,
note, de-gree, com-pile.
Dignified and deliberate discourse, awe, reverence, doubt,
and grief, require slow time: gayety, cheerfulness, anger, and
eager argument, and, generally, parenthetical clauses, demand
a quick time or utterance.
There is not a greater fault, nor one more prevalent, among
readers and speakers, than a neglect to protract the sounds of
the tonick elements. In the enunciation of dignified and delib-
erate discourse, especially, the importance of giving the long
concrete to such elements as admit and require it, cannot be too
strictly regarded by him who wishes to attain that commanding
power over language which is calculated to please, to impress,
and to excite the admiration of his hearers.
Hence, it may not be improper again to present this subject
in the form of a
RULE.
The protracting or lengthening of all such ton-
ick and subtonick elements as will admit of it,
adds greatly to distinctness of articulation, and
expression in delivery.

RHETORICAL PAUSES.
.
A Ruetorical Pause is one not dependant on
the grammatical construction of a sentence, but a
pause made merely to enable the speaker to pro-
nounce a preceding, or a succeeding, word or
phrase in a peculiar tone, or with uncommon
force. The shortest Rhetorical Pause is indica-
ted by two dots, thus (..); a longer pause, by
12

134

>
three dots, (...); and a pause still longer, by
four, (....).
When justly made, rhetorical pauses tend greatly to heighten
the effect of a passage. They may, in general, be better regu-
lated by good taste, than by any set of rules.
Example.—“ Alexander wept." "The great and invincible
“
Alexander. wept at the fate of Darius.”
Remark.-NO
grammatical
pause
is allowable between a
nominative and its verb, unless they are separated by an inter-
vening adjunct of considerable length or importance. Hence,
in the sentence, Alexander wept,” no pause is required bo
tween the nominative and the verb; but,
RULE I.
When the nominative has an adjunct prefired,
and the verb, an adjunct aſfixed, a pause is neces-
sary between them; as, “The great and invinci-
ble Alexander .. wept at the fate of Darius.”
Remark. If the unpractised student be made to understand,
that, in this last example, the phrases in Ilalicks, constitute the
adjuncts, he will readily perceive the importance and the ap-
plication of the Rule.

regarded as relative symbols for pausing, or, in other words,
as signs employed to denote, not only the place for pausing,
but, also, the relative time between one pause and another.
Hence, the proper length of every pause, depends entirely on
the structure of the passage, and the nature of the sentiments,
enunciated. Wherever the composition and the sentiments ad-
mit of a rapid or an accelerated movement of the voice, the
pauses, in general, should be shorter than in those instances in
which a slower movement is required.
Example.-The lawyer, the stranger, and the lady, all be-
came friendly, social, and witty over their wine.
Remark. --It must be obvious to every one, that the appro-
priate pauses in this example, are much shorter than would be
allowable in the following
Examples.—Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: the God
of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in
Mesopotamia.

A good, a great, a brilliant man, may fall a victim to power;
but truth, and reason, and liberty, must fall with him.
She sobbed, and sighed, and turned her weeping eye
To th' lorn, lost, lonely object of her love.
It should, therefore, be borne in mind, that the arbitrary
marks or signs called points, are not to be considered as indic-
ative of the precise nature and length of the respective pauses
which a good elocution demands; but these, as has been already
remarked, are to be regulated by the nature and character of
the sentiments uttered.
Grammatical pauses have respect to the utterance of lan-
guage in such a manner as merely to make the meaning intel-
ligible; but rhetorical pauses contemplate something more:
when happily and skilfully applied, their effect is to heighten
the beauty and meaning, and increase the force, of the senti-
ments delivered.
Rhetorical pauses may
be still farther indicated by
RULE II.
A nominative noun, when unaccompanied by
an adjunct, generally requires a slight pause be
tween it and its verb; as, “ Religion . . claims
the first place in our hearts: reason . . has ai
equal demand on our heads."

Remarks.--In those places distinguished by the dots, in the
foregoing examples, it would be improper to insert any one of
the points of punctuation; yet nothing can be more evident to
a chaste ear, than that a short pause in each of these places,
tends to present the meaning in a clearer and more striking
point of view than it would be without such rhetorical pause.
In the following sentence from Pope, it will be perceived
that no grammatical pause is required immediately after the
word “is," yet, in order to bring out the meaning at the close
with full energy and effect, a good reader would not fail to
take advantage of the rhetorical pause, by throwing it in be-
tween the words "is," and "his.”
Escample.--On whatever side we contemplate Homer, what
principally strikes us, is ... his wonderful in-VEN-tion.

dots in the following examples, are usually denominated EM-

EMPHATICK PAUSE.
An EMPHATICK PAUSE is a rhetorical pause,
occurring either immediately before, or after,
some striking thought is uttered, to which thought
the speaker wishes to direct the special attention
of his hearers.

and soldiers fought, her senators and magistrates made and en-
acted laws, for , . sor-did considerations; and Rome, from a
republick, became an empire, relinquished her literary emi-
nence, her virtue, and her liberty, declined ... and FELL.
And, where the future márs or makes,
The soul shall glance o’er all to be,
While sun is quenched, or system breaks,
FIXED ... in its own eternity.
Remarks. In this last example, the effect will be increased
by dropping the voice after the word "fixed” to an under-key.
The effect is, also, sometimes wonderfully heightened by chan-
ging the key-note on the emphatick word itself, and, more espe-
cially, by protracting the sounds of the tonick elements.
The happy application of rhetorical pauses, requires the ex-
ercise of no small degree of judgment and good taste; and
when thus applied, they prove faithful and powerful auxiliaries
in good delivery. No one of common discrimination, can but
perceive, for example, the happy effect of the rhetorical pauses,
as indicated by the dots, in the following examples, although an
ordinary reader would pronounce them without any such pauses.
Examples.-
No useless coffin .. enclosed his breast,
Nor in sheet, nor in shroud, we bound him;
But he lay... like a warriour taking his rest ...
With his martial cloak around him.

But.. left him alone ... with his glory.

an interest in the mind of the learner, and to direct his attention
to this important subject-a subject in which he may find am-

POETRY AND VERSIFICATION.
POETRY is the language of passion, or of enli-
yened imagination.
VERSIFICATION, in English, is the harmonious
arrangement of a particular number and variety
of accented and unaccented syllables, according
to particular laws.
Ruyme is the correspondence of the sound of

the last syllable in one line, to the sound of the
last syllable in another; as,
There sea-born gales their gelid wings expand
To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.
BLANK Verse consists in poetical thoughts ex-
pressed in regular numbers, but without the cor-
respondence of sound at the end of the lines which
constitutes rhyme; as,
The waters slept: night's silvery veil hung low
On Jordan's bosom, and the eddies curled
Their glassy rings beneath it, like the still,
Unbroken beating of the sleeper's pulse.
POETICAL FEET consist in a particular arrange-
ment and connexion of a number of accented and
unaccented syllables. They are called feet, be-
cause it is by their aid that the voice, as it were,
steps along through the verse in a measured
pace.
All poetick feet consist either of two, or of three, syllables;
and are reducible to eight kinds; four of two syllables each,
and four of three, as follows:
A Trochee has the first syllable accented, and the last an-
accented; as, Hāteful, pélting:
Rēstléss mortals toil för naught;
Bliss on ēarth in vāin is sought;
Bliss, 5 native öf thẻ skỹ,
Nevěr wanděrs.
An lambus has the first syllable unaccented, and the last ac-
cented; as, Bětrāy, consist:
Thẻ sẽas shill wäste, thẻ skies in smoke dẻoảy,
Rocks fāll to dūst, and mountains mēlt away:
Bắt fix'd his word, his sāving power rėmains;
Thý realm för ēvēr lāsts, thỹ own Messiah rēigns.
A Dactyle has the first syllable accented, and the last two
unaccented; as, Lābourěr, possible:
From thè low plēasăres of this fällën nātúre.
An Anapæst has the first two syllables unaccented, and the
last accented; as, Contråvēne, acquiesce:
At thě close of thě dāy whěn thč hãmlot is still,
And mörtăls tho swěēts of forgētfülnoss prove,

The Spondee ; as, āmēn: a Pyrrhick ; as, on thě-tall tree:
an Amphibrach; as, Delightful: a Tribrach; as, Nu-měräble.
In English versification, some of these feet are much more
common than others; but not unfrequently we meet with several
kinds introduced into the same piece of composition. This de-
velopment of poetick numbers, also evinces the copious stock of
materials at the command of the English versifier: for we are
not only allowed the use of all the ancient, poetick feet, in our
heroick measure, but we have duplicates of each kind, agreeing
in movement, though differing in sound, and which make dif-
ferent impressions on the ear-an opulence peculiar' to our lan-
guage, and one that
may be the source of a boundless variety.
By looking again at the foregoing definitions, the young
reader will perceive, that the essential qualities or characteris-
ticks of poetry, consist not, as is too often supposed, in harmon-
ick numbers, or feet, or rhymes, but in a peculiar kind of sen-
timent and conception, called poetick thought. The peculiar
nature of poetick thought, however, is not to be learned from
definition or description, any more than countenance is, but by
observation—by attention to the conceptions, thoughts, senti-
ments, and language of the best poets. Hence, unless the
thought is poetick, all the ornaments of poetick dress--the
paraphernalia of numbers, arrangement, and rhythm, cannot
elevate it to the dignity of true poetry. We, therefore, much
more frequently meet with verses than with poetry. At pres-
ent, however, it is not the author's purpose to discuss the qual-
ities and merits of poetry, but merely to make a few remarks
a
on the
MANNER OF READING POETRY.
The foregoing directions for acquiring a just and a happy
elocution, have been chiefly applied to the enunciation of prose:
and, although most of them are equally applicable to the read-
ing of poetry, yet, in the reading of verse, and particularly
rhyming verse, some peculiarities arise out of the nature of the
composition itself, which seem to require a brief notice.
OF POETICAL PAUSES.
There are three kinds of pauses brought into
requisition in the elegant enunciation of poetry:
first, Sentential or Grammatical Pauses, or those

which merely mark the sense ; secondly, Rhe-
torical Pauscs, or those employed for the purpose
of producing oratorical effect; and, thirdly, Har-
monick Pauses, or such as are demanded by the
melody and harmony of the numbers, and the pe-
culiarity of the rhythm.
Harmonick pauses are sometimes divided into the Final
pause, and the Cæsural pause. These sometimes coincide with
the sentential and the rhetorical pauses, and sometimes they
are independent of them.
In rhyme, the Final Pause takes place at the
end of the line, marks the measure, and shows
the correspondence of sound between the rhy-
ming syllables.
EXAMPLES.
But where to find the happiest spot below,
Who can direct, when all pretend to know ?
Such is the patriot's boast, where'er we roam,
His first best country ever is at home.
Though patriots flaiter, still shall wisdom find
An equal portion dealt to all mankind.
Remarks.-In reading these examples, it will be noticed,
that the final pause, at “below" and “roam,” coincides with
the sentential, but that, at the word “ find," it does not. The
final
pause is so important in rhyme, even when it does not
coincide with the sentential, as to merit another example:-
Save, that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient, solitary reign.
Remarks—The final pause at“ complain," takes (as it always
does when not in alliance with the sentential pause) the rising
inflection, and, in order to produce its proper effect
, must be
very slight. This pause also occurs at the words “then,"
"bright," and "when," on page 130.
In regard to the application of the final pause in reading
blank verse, nothing can betray a greater want of rhetorical
taste and philosophical acumen, than the directions of Mr. Mur.

every line, whether it coincides with the sentential pause or
not. The following is an example which they bring forward
to illustrate their absurd notions on this point.
Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world, and all our wo,
With loss of Eden, till one greater man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
Sing, heavenly muse!
To say that the final pause applied to "fruit". "taste," and
" man,” in this example, would serve "to mark the difference
between prose and verse, or to say that, unless we “make
every line sensible to the ear," we mar the melody, and sup-
press the numbers of the poet, is all nonsense. Although poetry
has much to do with numbers, and feet, and melody, yet, what
have these trappings of poetry, or poetry itself, to do with any
particular number of lines or feet? May not four feet be just
as poetick as five; or fifteen feet, as poetick as fifty? What
has the ear to do, then, with any particular number of feet?
The truth is, the distinctive difference between the poetry of
blank verse and prose, depends on no such slender principle as
that here referred to; but it rests on a much stronger, and a
far more elevated, basis. The poetry of blank verse, like that
of rhyme, depends primarily on the majesty, and beauty, and
poetičk character of the thought; and secondarily on the
imagery and the harmony of the numbers
. The application of
the final pause, then, at the end of a line in blank verse, (ex-
cept when it coincides with the sentential pause,) is just as ab-
surd as it would be at the end of a line in prose; but the appli-
cation of this pause in rhyme, has its peculiar and happy effect,
which has been already described. By turning to pages 126
and 127, and by applying this pause at the words "skill" and
"offence," and by omitting it in pronouncing the words " fight,".
waves, slope," "treasures," and "me," the propriety and
force of these remarks will be sufficiently apparent.

CÆSURAL PAUSE.
The CÆSURAL PAUSE divides the line into equal
or unequal parts.
In heroick verse, it commonly falls on the fourth, fifth, or
sixth syllable.
EXAMPLES.

Round broken columns'' clasping ivy twined.

Outstretched he lay" on the cold ground" and oft
Looked up to heaven.
In this last example, the line is divided into three portions
by two cæsuras: in the following, it is divided into four por-
tions, by the introduction of one cæsural, and two Demi-Cæsum
ral pauses, which are indicated by the single acute accent (');
Warms' in the sun" refreshes' in the breeze;
Glows' in the stars' and blossoms' in the trees;
Lives' through all life" extends through all extent;
Spreads' undivided" operates' unspent.
The regularity and harmony of numbers, and the sameness
of sound in pronouncing rhymes, strongly solicit the voice to a
sameness of tone; and tone, unless directed by a judicious ear,
is apt to degenerate into a song; and a song in elocution, is, to
one of refined taste, of all things the most disgusting. In order
to avoid this unendurable sing-song or chant, in enunciating
poetry, the best precaution that can be given, is, for the reader
who is guilty of it, to forget, as it were, that he is pronouncing
verses, and to adopt the easy and natural style which would be
just in reading prose.

ciation, as to render it impossible for the tyro in elocution to
attend to them all at the first reading. The author suggests,
cherefore, the propriety of the pupil's attending, in his first
reading of these exercises, merely to the correct orthoepy, and
a distinct articulation, of the words. In his second reading,
let him attend particularly to a proper modulation and inflection
of them. In his third reading, let his attention be solely direct-
ed to the emphasis and rhetorical pauses requisite to be observed
in a just enunciation of the examples. In his fourth and fifth
readings of these passages, let him give those words containing
the accented vowels, that full and" voluptuous swell” and prol-
ongation of sound which a rich, deep, and harmonick intona-
tion imperiously demands. In reference to the explosion and
protraction of the tonick and subtonick elements, let him not be
afraid to get his mouth off, nor to open his throat; but, as na-
ture has been bountiful in bestowing upon us organs capable of
producing soft, smooth, and graceful, musical, powerful, and
expressive sounds, and as art has been ingenious and wise in
the contrivance of language so admirably adapted to the happy
exercise of the vocal powers, let him give these organs full
play, and make the most of the words which he utters.
When the learner shall have read these examples five or six
times over, attending, according to the directions, to only one
thing, or, at most, to two things, at each reading, he will be
prepared to enunciate them with his attention directed to all
the various marks appended to the examples, as he goes along.
It is presumed that no teacher will expect either improvement
or a happy performance on the part of his pupil, unless he him-
self pronounce each sentence of paragraph in his own most
eloquent and masterly manner, before the pupil is allowed to
utter it.
These examples are designed to illustrate particularly, first,
the importance of protracting the tonick and subtonick elements
with a full volume and melodious swell; secondly, the impor-
tance and proper application of rhetorical pauses; and, lastly,
the final pause in rhyming verse. This lastnamed pause takes
place at the words "ties,'' "given,” and “burn," in the second
and third of the poetick examples; but it will be observed that,
at the words “discontent" and "chamber," in the last example
*
which is blank verse-no such pause
is requisite.
The pupil should be cautioned against placing a stress upon
any of the vowel sounds that require prolongation, except when
they occur in words really emphatick; and, also, against per-

verting them; that is, giving a long sound to a broad or a
flat sound, or the reverse.
In the foregoing examples, the most important one as an
exercise for the student, is the Dialogue; as it forcibly illus
trates the great difference in time and quantity which ought to
be observed in enunciating different kinds of composition. The
greater portion of words uttered by the Jew, should be
pro-
nounced more than twice as slowly as those spoken by Bas-
sanio. The long quantity on the phrase, “Three thousand
ducats," and in the inverted, unequal wave on the word "well,”
should amount to a drawl. The paragraph commencing with
"Ho, no, requires a quicker movement, and a more animated
intonation.
The closing paragraph in blank verse, also demands a very
slow movement of the voice.

CHAPTER VI.
OF RHETORICAL ACTION.
In a rhetorical sense, Action seems to imply
those characteristicks of delivery included under
the terms Gesture, Attitude, and Expression of
countenance.
This important part of good delivery, is much less regarded,
and, consequently, much less cultivated, by the moderns, than it
was by the ancients. A just and an elegant adaptation of every
part of the body, and of every expression of the countenance, to
the nature and import of the subject one is delivering, may be
considered, however, as too essential a part of oratory to be
passed by unnoticed.
As more or less action must necessarily accompany the
words of every speaker who delivers his sentiments in earnest,
as they ought to be in order to move and persuade, it is of the
utmost importance to him that that action be appropriate and
natural-never forced and awkward, but easy and graceful, ex-
cept where the nature of the subject requires it to be bold and
vehement.
The prescribed limits of the author, however, permit him
to present only a mere sketch of the outlines of this important
subject, leaving it to the dictates of good sense and cultivated
taste to fill them up.
OF GESTURE,
Gesticulation and expression of countenance, are the lan:
guage of nature; and, as they spring from the heart and the
feelings, when legitimately called forth, they convey a language
that reaches the heart. But because it is urged, that gestures
must be natural, it is not hence to be inferred, that they must
be the spontaneous efforts of nature, unaided by art or culti-
vation. In this, as well as in those things which relate to the
cultivation of the vocal powers, we call in the aid of art, not to
pervert, but to refine, to exalt, to perfect nature. No one thinke

.
of becoming skilled in dancing, or in vocal or instrumental
musick, or in mathematicks, or logick, without long and close
application to the subject, under an able teacher, or in private.
If one would excel in penmanship, he places himself under the
instruction of a professor in the art; if he would become an
adept in wrestling or boxing, he receives instruction from a pro-
fessor in pugilisticks; if he wishes to be skilled in horseman-
ship, he puts himself under a ridingmaster: or else he attains
any one of these objects, by private application and long prac-
tice. When Caspar Hauser was first thrown into Nuremburg,
at the age of seventeen, after having been confined all his life
in a narrow dungeon, he did not know how to walk ! Although
nature had performed her whole duty to this youth, she had
not taught him this art; nor would she ever have taught him,
nor would he ever have learned, to walk, had he not exerted
his capabilities for the attainment of this object, by repeated and
persevering efforts. If, then, any one would excel in gesticula-
tion, or in any other important qualification of an orator, let
him assiduously set about the cultivation of his natural powers;
and if he cannot avail himself of the instructions of a compe-
tent master in the art, he may, at least, glean useful hints from
books that treat upon the subject, and, more especially, by ob-
serving the manner adopted by the best speakers: but let him
bear in mind, that, in order to excel, in this, or in any other im-
portant attainment, he must accompany his desires by private
application and persevering efforts.
If argument were necessary to enforce the importance of
cultivation in gesticulation, one sufficiently cogent might be
drawn from the
graceful skill and power displayed in this art
by the best actors on the stage. No truth is clearer, than that
their masterly excellence is the fruit of their own industry.
But, in applying art to the aid of oratory, and especially in
copying the mien and gesture of those who excel in it, great
caution is to be observed. No true orator can be formed after
ANY MODEL. He that copies or borrows from any one whom he
looks up to as a standard of excellence, should be careful, in
the first place, not to copy his peculiarities or his defects.
Secondly, whatever is copied, should be so completely brought
under his command by long practice, as to appear perfectly
natural, and his own. Art should never be allowed to put any
constraint upon nature; but should be so completely refined
and subdued, as to appear to be the work of nature herself.
Whenever art, in a speaker, is allowed, in the slightest degree,
to put a constraint upon nature, it is immediately detected,

shows affectation, and is sure to disgust, rather than to please
and impress, the hearer.
The leading object of every publick speaker should be—to
persuade. In order to persuade, he must be able to please—to
affect the feelings and to move the heart. To accomplish all this,
the first important requisite, doubtless, is, to advance sound
arguments in clear and chaste language; but he should remem-
ber that arguments, when accompanied by appropriate gesture,
an earnest and a sincere expression of countenance, and a ma-
sterly intonation, come upon the hearer with a double force.
As we have no admitted standard of excellence in gesticula-
tion, we are left without ample data from which to draw a com-
plete set of rules to regulate all the proper movements of the
body, limbs, and features, which should take place in delivery.
In general terms, force and grace may be considered the lead-
ing qualities of good action. When combined, they mutually
support each other, and may be regarded as the most powerful
auxiliaries of oratory.
In presenting particular directions for gesture, it is easier to
give negative, than positive, instruction. In gesticulation, every
one knows, that the right hand should be much more frequent-
ly employed than the left; and that it should be brought down
with great energy when he wishes to enforce an important sen-
timent. In order to do this with full effect, it is equally appa-
rent, that the arm should be boldly extended, so as to give all
its muscles full play. A bold and manly freedom of gesture is
to be studied, as much as a cramped and awkward stiffness is
to be avoided. A contracted movement of the hand and arm,
appears trifling and ungraceful. Waves or curved lines de
.
scribed by the hand and arm, are far more graceful than straight
lines: and, although these may be studied and practised, yet, a
young speaker should studiously avoid all affected prettiness of
gesture, all theatrical trick and mimickry, and, especially, all
scholastick stiffness and measured, academical formality of
gesture. Every thing of this sort, appears unnatural, and, con-
sequently, produces an effect directly opposite to that which is
intended.
Those automatical gestures taught in our academies and
colleges, seldom do any good, frequently much harm. They
are generally imperfect imitations of abominably bad prece-
dents. Therefore, the first thing incumbent on a young man
who has had the misfortune to be thus mistaught, if he would
make himself an eloquent, or even a tolerable, speaker, is to
lay aside all that mechanical stiffness and set formality, and, by

degrees, to adopt the natural manner of those speakers whose
gestures bear none of the marks of study, but which seem to
burst forth as the spontaneous productions of the sentiments
delivered. But, above all, he should so completely conceal all
art, as not to allow his gestures to carry the least appearance
of DESIGN. Many a young speaker is distressingly encum-
bered with his hands and arms. They are greatly in his way.
When this is the case, if he is unwilling to cut them off, let
him strive to forget that he has any—and, at the same time,
lay about him lustily and fearlessly: Let him remember, that
it is no time to study attitude and gesture when he is address-
ing a publick audience; but that these should be so thoroughly
studied in private, as to enable him to make a happy use of
them in publick, as it were, without thought or effort.
These loose hints will be closed with one remark, which is,
that excess of action, is nearly as detrimental in oratory, as no
action. It becomes every speaker, therefore, in this, as well as
in every thing else that pertains to elocution and oratory, to
avoid extremes.
OF ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSION.
By a publick speaker, no small degree of attention should be
given to a proper dignity of mien. Let him appear graceful,
easy, and natural; and, when warmed and animated by the
importance of his subject, his dignity of mien should become
still more elevated and commanding, and assume a somewhat
lofty and noble bearing. Directly opposed to this, is the awk-
ward habit of frequently moving about, or changing place,
while addressing an audience. Although the attitude of the
speaker may be often changed, yet a shifting of place is rarely
admissible.
But the most important part of action consists in accompany.
ing one's sentiments by an appropriate expression of the counte-
The
eye of the orator, and the expressive movements
of the muscles of his face, often tell more than his words, his
body, or his hands. In regard to the use of that commanding
organ, the eye, it may be worthy of remark, that, when lighted
up
and glowing with meaning and intelligence, and frequently
and properly directed to the person or persons addressed, it
tends greatly to rivet the attention, and deepen the interest, of
the hearer, as well as to heighten the effect, and enforce the
importance, of the sentiments delivered. A publick speaker,
therefore, cannot fall into a greater errour, than to keep his
eyes much cast down, averted, or turned away from his auditory.

up
The most eloquent manner of reading and of speaking, is the
most easy of attainment, if sought for through the proper chan- .
nel; for it is as simple as it is natural. But many who aim
at it, fail by the very efforts adopted to gain it. They over-
reach the mark. They shoot too high. Instead of breathing
forth their sentiments in the fervid glow of simple nature, which
always warms, and animates, and interests the hearer, they
work themselves into a sort of frigid bombast, which chills
and petrifies him. One, therefore, who would read well, or
who would speak well—who would interest, rivet the attention,
convince the understanding, and excite the feelings of his hear-
ers-needs not expect to do it by any extraordinary exertion or
desperate effort; for genuine eloquence is not to be wooed and
won by any such boisterous course of courtship, but by more
gentle means. If one would become glowing and truly elo-
quent, he must rise naturally with his subject, and without
betraying the least art or effort.
As in grammar and rhetorick, so in eloquence, defects are
artificial, original beauties are natural. It is, therefore, a great
mistake to suppose that visible art can do any thing towards
making an orator, or an eloquent reader. Cultivation may do
much. The rules of every science, as far as they are just and
useful, are founded in nature, or in good usage. Hence, their
adoption and application tend to free us from our artificial de
fects, all of which may be regarded as departures from the
simplicity of nature. Let the student in elocution, then, bear
in mind, that whatever is artificial, is unnatural, and whatever
is unnatural, is directly opposed to genuine eloquence.
The reader must not suppose, however, that, in cautioning
him against an artificial and frigid vehemence of style in elo-
cution, any countenance is given to a cold and indifferent man-
A slight degree of extravagant warmth, is far more en-
durable than lifeless dulness and tameness. Notwithstanding
all the precautions proper to be observed, therefore, the reader
or speaker should not fail to enter with glowing fervour into
the spirit of the sentiments which he utters. He should always
be in EARNEST; and then, if his manner is simple, natural,
easy, and dignified, it cannot fail of being eloquent.

In reading, one should not confine his eyes too much to the
book. By this puerile practice, one-half of the effect of his
elocution is lost. A good reader has his eyes directed to his
hearers, nearly as much as to his book. Great effect
may
also
be produced, by occasionally casting his eyes upon some of the
most distant persons in the room. This is, as it were, to hold
a closer communion with them, by which their interest in what
is read, is greatly increased,
HINTS ON THE ELOQUENCE OF THE PULPIT.
The dignity and importance of this subject require that it
always be approached with solemn awe; but the very sacred-
ness of the theological office, has betrayed many a one into a
false notion of its true dignity and sanctity. A few, brief re-
marks, therefore, which go to point out some of the most prom-
inent errours and defects in delivery, prevalent among the
clergy of our country, may not be unworthy the attention of
young men who are just entering upon the duties of the min.
istry.
There is not, perhaps, a more common errour of delivery,
displayed by him who officiates in the sacred desk, than an af-
fected air of sanctimonious solemnity. This is often exhibited
in mien, gesture, and tone. But the preacher who is filled with
the grandeur and importance of his subject--who considers that
his object is, to convince his hearers of the truth of the sub-
lime doctrines of the Bible, and to persuade them to act in con-
formity to that conviction, will find no time for laying aside his
natural tones and mien, but will enter upon his labours in the
true spirit and dignity of native simplicity.
Affectation, like all other evils, is contagious. Many adopt
an affected tone and manner merely by imitating a bad prece
dent, and are not aware that they are thus tainted. Hence, it
would be well for a young speaker often to consider, whether
he has not mistaken, and adopted, some affected habits for nat-
ural graces. If his tones, gestures, and enunciation generally,
closely resemble those he would employ in familiar and earnest
discourse with others, they may commonly be regarded as
natural.
Affectation in the pulpit, is fashionable. This allusion is not
made in reference to that affectation of prettiness, adopted by
the weak and silly, nor that of sanctimonious austerity and
pompous dignity, displayed by the bigoted and hypocritical,
but in allusion to that affectation which shows itself in sectarian
tone or cant. There is a baptist tone or cant, a methodist cant,

of these cants,
a presbyterian cant, an episcopalian cant, a catholick cant, and
a quaker cant; but as there is no religion in any
as they are all disagreeable to a chaste ear, and degrading to
the true dignity of pulpit eloquence, the young clergyman would
do well to avoid them.
Though not unfrequently rude and boisterous, yet our meth-
odist preachers are more effective in their manner of delivery
than the more polished and scholastick clergy of some other
sects. Who has not observed, that with less learning, but more
zeal, with less argument, but more fervour, with less formality,
but more vehemence, the former often accomplish more than
the latter? And what is the cause of this singular difference?
One very plain reason is, in their manner, they are more nat-
URAL. Having drawn their information more from men than
books, the knowledge of the former is more practical in its
cast than that of the latter; and for this reason, they can apply
it to greater advantage, and effect more with small means, than
others do with means more ample. If they have not the ad-
vantage of scientifick acquirements and literary polish, neither
do they labour under the disadvantage of scholastick stiffness
and coldness. Although extravagance, and rant, and bawling,
and bombast, are by no means commendable in these "fair-
spoken days," yet, who would not rather have a preacher
breathe forth flames like the mares of Diomedon, and lay about
him like a mad dragon from the marshes of Lerna, than to
come upon them with frigid gusts from the top of mount Ural,
and congeal them into an iceberg ?
But without stretching farther this chain of unwelcome com-
parisons, it may be proper to notice one advantage which pul-
pit eloquence derives from a quarter whence it would seem to
be little expected, and that is, from the peculiar habits of " cir-
cuit riders. They who follow this course of itinerancy, gen-
"
erally acquire, in no small degree, what the clergy of other de-
nominations greatly need—a knowledge of human nature : and
in this we may perceive an illustration of that grand, equalizing
principle laid down by the great Dispenser of all good, by the
operation of which, all his creatures, provided they make a
proper use of the means placed within their reach, possess
nearly an equal chance for usefulness and happiness.
If many of our learned divines would study human nature
more, and books less, think more, and write less, extemporize
more in the pulpit, and read less in it, seek a closer walk with
God, and more frequent walks among their parishioners, they
would doubtless become far more eloquent and far more useful.

Beautiful Metaphor.—IRVING.
1. It is interesting to notice how some minds seem almost
to create themselves, springing up under every disadvantage',
and working their solitary', but irresistible', way through a
thousand obstacles'
. Nature seems to delight in disappointing
the assiduities of art', with which it would rear legitimate dul-
ness to maturity', and to glory in the vigour and luxuriance of
her chance productions'. She scatters the seeds of genius to
the winds, and', though some may perish among the stony
places of the world', and some be choked by the thorns and
brambles of early adversity', yet, others will now and then
strike root even in the clefts of the rock', struggle bravely up
into sunshine', and spread over their steril birthplace all the
beauties of vegetation.
REMARKS ON SECTION I.
Articulation.-In reading these selections, the first thing to be attend-
ed to, is a clear and distinct articulation of every word, and every sylla-
ble, and every letter of each syllable, silent letters only excepted.
Modulation. The second important requisite is, to vary the intonation
with all the different modulations of the voice which a just and a happy
elocution requires. This direction refers to all the varied movements
of the voice, considered in regard to pitch, tone, inflection, stress, and
cadence, and especially to the prolongation of the tonick and subtonick
elements.
Inflection.- In reading the 1st paragraph, the rising inflection takes
place at the words “disadvantage," maturity," and "sunshine,” in
accordance with Rule 7, page 82; and the falling, is made at them-
selves” and “winds,” agreeably to Exception 1, to Rule 7. The rising
infection occurs at "world" and "adversity,”'according to Exception

ancient piles', majestick solitudes, a purer air, fresher vegeta-

and meditative', seem to whisper us that', in climbing the domes

2, to the same rule: and this same Exception applies to the inflection
at“ vine," "oak," "sunshine," "will," " thunderbolt," " boughs,” “Prov:
idence," "woman,” and “ hours,” in the 2nd paragraph. The word
head,” in paragraph 2nd, takes the rising inflection, according to
Rule 7.
In paragraph 3d, the words “solitudes," "air,” and “vegetation,"
“hues," : horizon," and "mind," are inflected according to a licensed
use of the rules for inflecting a commencing, compound series.
In the 4th paragraph, the words “come,"
fire," "world,"
and “dim," nation, despotism,"
," "glory," and "freemen,” take the
rising infection, agreeably to Exception 2, to Rule 7.
Emphasis.--In paragraph 1st, the idea of some minds' creating them.
selves, is contrasted with the implied idea of other minds which are
supposed not to create themselves. See page 112. Though some might
expect nature to grieve, yet she" seems to delight, in disappointing the
assiduities of art.” But the emphasis on delight,” as well as on
"chance," "winds," "stony," "adversity,"" clefts,” and “rock,” may
be properly referred to the principle contained in Rule 2, page 115, and
be denominated emphasis of specification.
The emphatick force which falls upon "vine" and "woman," in the
2nd paragraph, is antithetick, according to Rule 1, page 112.

4. How different is the scene which we this day behold',
from that which was displayed on this spot fifty years ago.
The traces of havock have been erased by the hand of time'.
The farmer's boy now sips his beverage beside the blue stream
once crimsoned with human gore:- Where banners and plumes
went down amid the shock of battle', now the golden harvest
waves its yellow sheaves'
. Where rolled the purple stream of
blood', is now beheld the gambols of childhood and the frolick
of youth'. The angel of peace now hovers over her domestick
altárs with outspread wings.
If the time ever come', when this mighty fabrick shall totter';
when the beacon of joy that now rises in a pillar of fire', a sign
and a wonder of the world', shall wax dim', the cause will be
found in the ignorance of the people'. If our Union is still to
continue to cheer the hopes and animate the oppressed of
every nation'; if our fields are to be untrodden by the hirelings
of despotism', if long days of blessedness are to attend our
;
country in her career of glory'; if you would have the sun
continue to shed unclouded rays upon the face of freemen',
then', educate all the children in the land'. This alone', startles
the tyrant in his dreams of power', and rouses the slumbering
energies of an oppressed people. It is INTELLIGENCE that
reared up the majestick columns of our national glory'; and
this alone can prevent them from crumbling into ashes.
The name of the particular subject of remark or discourse, as it is
antithetically employed when considered in reference to any and every
other subject
that might be brought under consideration, always becomes
emphatick. Hence, the word " mountains," in paragraph 3d, requires a
moderate degree of the median stress. In these remarks, Mr. Flint
does not wish to call our attention to valleys, rivers, lakes, or oceans, but
particularly to mountains.—Thus we have revealed the true philosophy
of that percussive force called emphasis: and the inquiring mind that
follows out this principle, as it pervades, more or less, every sentence
uttered, and regulates every species of emphatick force, will be no less
delighted with its simplicity, than astonished at its extent. But, in this
example, again, as far as any practical purpose is to be subserved, and
perhaps, too, as far as accuracy is concerned, it would be better to style
the emphatick force which falls on mountains," and that still slighter
degree which falls on "mysteries, ," "fires," "solitudes," "air," “ vege.
tation," and so forth, emphasis of specification, in accordance with Rule
2. The same rule may also be applied to ignorance," "people,"
"educate, all," and "intelligence,” in paragraph 4th,
Many of the emphatick words in these paragraphs, are not marked ;
and many that are marked, it would be too tedious to comment upon.
Rhetorical Pause.-In section 1st, the rhetorical pauses are not mark-
ed, or indicated by dots. A just elocution requires them to be observed,

are', yet remain as lasting monuments of his genius and patriot-
ism. He saw', at last', his hopes fulfilled' : he saw the Con.
stitution adopted', and the government under it', established and
organized". "The discerning eye of Washington immediately
called him to a post', infinitely the most important in the ad-
ministration of the new system'. He was made Secretary of
the Treasury'; and how he fulfilled the duties of such a place',
at such a time', the whole country perceived with delight', and
the whole world', with admiration. He smote the rock of the
national resources', and abundant streams of revenue gushed
forth'. He touched the dead corpse of the publick credit', and
it sprang upon its feet'. The fabled birth of Minerva', from
the brain of Jove', was hardly more sudden or more perfect
than the financial system of the United States which burst forth
from the conceptions of ALEXANDER HAMILTON.

In reading the third paragraph, a slight rhetorical pause should be

REMARKS ON SECTION II.
The leading remarks applicable to the various paragraphs of Section
2, amount to nothing more than a repetition of those already applied to
Section 1. Very few will, therefore, be presented. The young reader
cannot be too particular, however, in his attention to a distinct articula-
tion and a correct orthoepy, in addition to the attention required in ap-
propriately applying the rules for inflection, emphasis, pause, and so
forth-not only in enunciating the examples in this section, but, also, in
reading every piece he may be called on to pronounce.
Inflection. - In the 1st paragraph, the word " Treasury' being emphat-
ick, takes the falling inflection, in accordance with Exception 1, to Rule
7, page 82. This sentence is brought under the rule, or Exception, by
considering that portion of it which follows the word Treasury, one
compound member, answering to the simple member which closes with
Treasury.
In paragraph 2nd, the rising inflection takes place at “words,"
rhetorick," "dcclamation," and " inane,” in accordance with Rule 3,

Eloquence of Daniel Webster.
2. It was in the Senate that I first became enamoured with
the wonderful eloquence of this great man. Every word that
issued from his lips', seemed like the battle-axe of a warriour',
falling upon the helmet of his foe', and striking him to the
earth. It was not the mere rippling of wordsthe bubbling
of rhetorick'—the gingling and gurgling of empty declama-
tion—frothy, flashy', and inane'; but the mighty rushing of a
thinking, logical', and ratiocinative' mind' deep, original',
and intellectual'—where every word was a thought", sometimes
flashing with brilliancy'; at others', stunning with force', or
startling with sublimity --where every sentence was an argu-
ment', and every argument excited a feeling corresponding to
the thought-holding the heart and the mind captive at the
same time. Sometimes it resembled the tramp of a trooper',
crushing a young forest beneath his courser's feet' : at others',
the boiling torrent, tumbling mountains of errour into the
abyss of sophistry': and then', again', it resembled a dignified
chieftain in his battle career', leading on his legions to sweep
an enemy to destruction.
Such was the effect of his eloquence upon me', that it seemed
as if I actually heard the battle-axe'-one argument backing
another in rapid and restless succession', until', like the piling
of Pelion upon Ossa', they crushed and overwhelmed his an-
tagonists'. It is not surprising that a mind of this exalted
order and finished character', should excite the admiration of

ously rested on expectation; but he now saw them fulfilled. Again," he
was made Secretary of the Treasury," and not, Ambassador to France,
Vice President of the United States, or some other publick officer.

the emphasis, and is inarked as the downward, in accordance with the
second part of Exception 2nd to Rule 7.
The inflection at “injustice,” in paragraph 1st, " learned,” in para-
graph 2nd, and "publick,” in the 3d paragraph, forms an exception to
Rule 7, being under the control of emphatick force.
Articulation. The student in elocution, should constantly bear in
mind, the great importance of giving to every word, syllable, and letter
which he utters, a clear and distinct articulation; and that a distinct
articulation is greatly promoted, by observing a due degree of slowness
in pronunciation, by adopting a full and bold explosion, and an appro-
priate protraction, of all the tonick and subtonick elements, and by paying
strict attention to all the necessary grammatical and rhetorical pauses.
Modulation. In enunciating the 2nd paragraph, the voice, at the
commencement, should be pitched upon its ordinary, speaking key;
but, as soon as it advances io the word “power," in the first line, it
should be lowered one tone ; and this under key should be preserved'in
pronouncing the whole of the intervening phrase ending with the word
possessed," when, at the word " should," the same pitch should be
resumed that was dropped at the word "power.” Such intervening

ed by accidental calamities', should be set at ease by the care

feited their claims to favour', ought, rather', to be made useful
to the society which they have injured', than driven from it'.
But the poet is employed in a more pleasing task than that
of proposing laws' .. which', however just and expedient, will
never be made'; or of endeavouring to reduce to rational
schemes of government', societies which were formed by
chance', and which are conducted by the private passions of
those who preside in them. He guides the unhappy fugitive
from want and persecution', to plenty, quieť, and security, and
seats himself in peaceful scenes of solitude and undisturbed
peace.

phrases, or interrupters of the sense, are of very frequent recurrence,
and demand particular attention in elocution. Like parenthetick
clauses, they express a meaning not necessary to the sense of the sea.
lences in which they occur, and yet, not sufficiently foreign to it to allow
the distinctive marks of the parenthesis to be applied to them; and,
therefore, they do not require quite so low a tone as parenthetick clauses.
A happy variety in modulation will be greatly promoted, by observ-
ing to give all the appropriate inflections and waves of the voice, by a
distinct articulation, and frequent protraction of the elements of speech,
and, especially, by a strong and varied explosion of emphatick force.
REMARKS ON SECTION IV.
Semitone.—The sarcastick irony of the 2nd paragraph, requires the
adoption of the semitone and wave, particularly in pronouncing the
phrases "great men,"

prodigally lavished'. .than upon America'. Her mighty lakes',
like oceans of liquid silver'; her mountains', with their bright',
aerial teints'; her valleys', teeming with wild fertility'; her tre-
mendous cataracts, thundering in their solitudes; her bound-
less plains, waving with spontaneous verdure'; her broad',
deep rivers, rolling in solemn silence to the ocean'; her track-
less forests', where vegetation puts forth all its magnificence';
her skies'
, kindling with the magick of summer clouds and glo-
rious sunshine':-nô', never need an American' .. look beyond
his own country for the sublime and beautiful of natural scenery:
But Europe'. . holds forth all the charms of storied and
poetical association: There are to be seen the master-pieces of
art', the refinements of highly cultivated society, the quaint
peculiarities of ancient and local customs": Americá .. is full
of youthful promise'; Europe' .. is rich in the accumulated
treasures of age. Her very RUINS' .. tell the history of
times gone by', and every mouldering stone' .. is a chronicle'.
It is pleasant to wander over the scenes of renowned achieve-
ment--to tread', as it were', in the footsteps of antiquity—to
loiter about the ruined castle-to meditate on the falling tower
—to escape', in short', from the commonplace realities of the
present, and lose one's self among the shadowy grandeurs of

the past'.

Inflection.-Before each of the members of the second sentence in par-
agraph 3d, the phrase " There are,” is understood, so that each member
constitutes a distinct, affirmative proposition, requiring at "lakes,"
mountains," " valleys," and so on, and at "silver," teints," "fertility,"
and so forth, the falling inflection, agreeably to Rule 1, page 75.
To the Teacher.-In exercising his pupils in these " Select Para-
graphs,” and, also, in other selections, the teacher would do well to re-
quire them to read each sentence, paragraph, or section, several times
over, before they proceed to another paragraph or section. In the first
reading, particular attention should be given to a distinct articulation
and protraction of the elementary sounds; in the second reading, to
inflection; in the third, to emphasis ; in the fourth, to pause ; in the fifth,
to modulation ; in the sixth, to time; and, lastly, let the pupil endeav-
our to display all the qualities of voice requisite to a happy and forcible
elocution. But, inasmuch as example speaks louder than precept, let
not the teacher forget the importance of illustrating every thing with
his own voice before he requires his pupil to do it.

Accent.-In reading poetry, it is inadmissible to sacrifice sense to
sound. Hence, care should be taken not to lay åny stress upon little
words that would not admit of it in prose: as in the lines
“Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,
As, to be hated, needs but to be seen."
In enunciating this example, many would accent, or lay a stress upon,
the words “is," " of,” and “to,” in order to perfect the poetick feet, or

Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings';

It is an attribute to God himself';

Note. In order to promote the attainment of good reading, the author
begs leave once more to insist on the importance of teachers' requiring their
pupils to read each section many times over, even until they can enunciate
it both accurately and eloquently, before they are allowed to proceed to an-
other section. It should be borne in mind, that the higher degrees of excel-
lence in Elocution, are to be gained, not by reading much, but by pro-
nouncing what is read with a strict regard to the nature of the subject, the
structure of the sentences, the turn of the sentiment, and a correct and
judicious application of the rules of the science.

What honour could his name have derived from being mingled',

and venal eulogiums of a titled multitude'? What would a
crowded corner in Westminster Abbey have been', compared
with this reverend pile', which seems to stand in beautiful lone-
liness as his sole mausoleum'! The solicitude about the grave',
may be but the offspring of an overwrought sensibility'; but
human nature is made up of foibles and prejudices'; and its best
and tenderest affections are mingled with these factitious feela
ings'. He who has sought renown about the world', and has
reaped a full harvest of worldly favour', will find', after all',
that there is no love', no admiration', no applause', so sweet to
the soul as that which springs up in his native place'. It is
there that he seeks to be gathered in peace and honour', among
his kindred and his early friends'. And when the weary
heart
and the failing head begin to warn him that the evening of life
is drawing on', he turns as fondly as does the infant to its
mother's arms', to sink to sleep in the bosomd of the scene of
his childhood'.
How would it have cheered the spirit of the youthful bard',
when', wandering forth in disgrace upon a doubtful world', he
cast back a heavy look upon his paternal home', could he have
foreseen', that', before many years', he should return to it cov.
ered with renown'; that his name would become the boast and
the glory of his native place'; that his ashes would be religiously
guarded as its most precious treasure'; and that its lessening

ture'? The eash', inclining on its axis', presents in turn its two
hemispheres to the sun', causing us the grateful alternation of
day and night'; while the other motion presents us with the
varied aspects and delightful vicissitudes of the seasons'.
It is another harmony of the motions of the earth', that while
we are carried round with the greatest absolute rapidity', we
should have the sensation of being at rest'. The atmosphere',
and every relative landmark by which we could measure', and
be made to perceive this motion', are carried round with us';
and thus we have a consciousness that we have not changed
our place'. We have familiar examples of the deceptive char-
acter of this motion'. The fisherman', abandoning himself in
his boat to the stream', and boine down by the current', sees
the shores apparentlyd ascend', and seems himself at rest'. The
spectator on the shore', measures the progresse of the boat by
the trees', and discovers its true and absolute motion'. To us',
the sun and planets seem to advance from the eastern to the
western horizon'. A person who could contemplate this motion
from a fixed point in the heavens', would see the true and abso.
lute motion to be that of the earth advancing rapidly from west
to east'.
One beautiful harmony of the universe', resulting from this
illusive appearance of relative motion', compared with absolute
rest', must not be overlooked'. While movement' and repose',
darkness' and light', the changes of the seasons' and the march
of the stars', which diversify the decorations of the world',
to result from real change of place', they are successive only
. in appearance', being', in reality', permanent'.
The scene
· which is effaced from our view', is repainted for another peo-
ple'. It is not the spectator', but the spectacle only', that has

changed'. The Author of nature has seen fit to unite the ab.
solute and relative progress of succession', as well as of mo-
tion', in his beautiful work of creation'. The one is placed in
time', the other', in space'. By the one', the beauties of the
universe are perpetual', infinite', always the same'. By the
other', they are multiplied', finished', and renewed'. Without
the one', there would be no grandeur in creation'. Without
the other', it would have been all monotony'. _In this way',
time presents itself to view in a new relation'. The least of its
fractions becomes a complete whole'; which comprehends
every event', and modifies every change', from the death of an
insect to the birth of a world'. Every moment is', in itself', a
little eternity'. Bring together', then', in thought', the most
beautiful accidents' of nature': Suppose you see', at the same
moment', all the hours of the day', and all the aspects of the
seasons' -a morning of spring', and a morning of autumn'-
a burning noon of summer', and a noon of frost and snows'-
a night bespangled with stars', and a night of darkness and
clouds'-meadows enamelled with flowers', and forests robbed
of their foliaged by winter and storms'--plains covered with
springing corn', and gilded with harvests': you will then have
a just idea of the various aspects of the-universe as they are
presented', at the same moment', to different spectators'.
It is an astonishing fact, that while you admire the sun',
sinking under the arches of the west', another observer beholds
him springing from the regions of the morning'. By a won.
derful arrangement of the Creator', this ancient and unwearied
luminary that reposes from the heat and dust of the day behind
his golden canopy' in the west', is the same youthful planet
that awakes', humid with dew', from behind the whitening cur-
tain of the dawn'. At every moment of the day', to some of
our fellow-beings the sun is rising', blazing in the zenith', or
sinking behind the western wave'. Our senses present us this
charming illusion'. To a spectator', beholding from a fixed
point in space', there would be neither east', meridian', nor
west'; but the sun would blaze motionless from his dome'.
Let us imagine the view of the spectacle', if the laws of na-
ture were abandoned to the slightest change'. The clouds',
obeying the laws of gravity', would fall perpendicularly on the
earth'; or would ascend beyond condensation into the upper re-
gions of the air'. At one period', the air would become too
gross', and at the next', too much rarefied', for the organs of

respiration'. The moon', too near', or too distant from us',
would be at one time invisible', and at another', would show
herself bloody and covered with enormous spots', or filling
with her extended orb all the celestial dome': As if possesseda
of some wild caprice', she would either move upon the line of
the ecliptick', or', changing her sides', would at length discover
to us a face which the earth has not seen'. The stars', smitten
with the same uncertainty of motion', would rush together', and
become a collection of terrifick conjunctions'. On a sudden',
the constellation of summer would be destroyed by that of win.

roar in Aquarius'. Here', the stars would fly away with the
rapidity of lightning'; there', they would hang motionless in
the heavens'. Sometimes', crowding into groups', they would
form a new Milky-way'. Again', disappearing altogether', and
rending the curtain of worlds', they would open to view the
abysses of eternity'. Reason as we will upon the inherent laws
of nature',' second causes are not sufficient to explain all the
phenomena'. There must be a perpetual and omnipotent vigi.
lance always sustaining these laws in their equilibrium'. God
would need no other effort to destroys this great work', than to
abandon it to itself'. Our confidence that these laws will
never change', must rest upon our conviction of the immortality
of his character'.

SECTION VI.
Extract from Essays on Scenes in Italy.-LADY MORGAN.
It struck my imagination much, while standing on the last
field fought by Bonaparte, that the battle of Waterloo should
have been fought on a Sunday. What a different scene did the
Scotch Grays and English Infantry present, from that which,
at that very hour, was exhibited by their relatives, when over
England and Scotland each church-bell had drawn together its
worshippers! While many a mother's heart was sending up
prayer for her son's preservation, perhaps that son was gasp-
ing in agony. Yet, even at such a period, the lessons of his
early days might give him consolation; and the maternal prayer

AFFECTION FOR THE DEAD.
might prepare the heart to support maternal anguish. It is re-
ligion alone which is of universal application, both as a stimu-
lant and a lenitive, throughout the varied heritage which falls to
the lot of man. But we know that many thousands rushed
into this fight, even of those who had been instructed in our
religious principles, without leisure for one serious thought ;
and that some officers were killed in their ball dresses. They
made the leap into the gulf which divides two worlds—the
present from the immutable state, without one parting prayer,
or one note of preparation !
As I looked over this field, now green with growing corn, I
could mark, with my eye, the spots where the most desperate
carnage had been marked out by the verdures of the wheat.
The bodies had been heaped together, and scarcely more than
covered : and só enriched is the soil, that, in these spots, the
grain never ripens. It grows rank and green to the end of
harvest. This touching memorial, which endures when the
thousand
groans have expired, and when the stain of human
blood has faded from the ground, still seems. to cry to Heaven
that there is awful guilt somewhere, and a terrifiek reckoning
for those who caused destruction which the earth could not con-
.ceal. These hillocks of superabundant vegetation, as the wind
rustled through the corn, seemed the most affecting monuments
which nature
could devise, and gave a melancholy animation to
this plain of death.
When we attempt to measure the mass of suffering which
was here inflicted, and to number the individuals that fell, con.
sidering each who suffered as our fellow-man, we are over-
whelmed with the agonizing calculation, and retire from the
field which has been the scene of our reflections, with the sim-
ple, concentrated feeling—these armies once lived, breathed,
and felt like us, and the time is at hand when we shall be
like them.

intimacy;--there it is that we dwell upon the tenderness', the
solemn', awful tenderness', of the parting scene'—the bed of

Hezekiah, King of Judah.--GLEIG.
SAMARIA fell, and Israel ceased to be an independent state
in the year 719, B. C. In the mean while, Ahaz, the impious
king of Judah, had been succeeded by his son Hezekiah, a
prince in every respect worthy to sit upon the throne of David.
He no sooner grasped the reins of government, than he applied
himself sedulously to the task of reforming the many abuses
which the wickedness of his predecessors had introduced..
Ahaz's idolatrous altar he withdrew from the temple, and re-
stored the original, that of Solomon, to its place; and after
cleansing the building itself from the pollutions which had been

introduced into it, he threw open its gates for publick worship.
He then summoned the priests and Levites together, ordered
them to sanctify themselves according to the directions given in
the law, and appointed them to offer proper sacrificesa in atone.
ment for the sins both of king and people. Not satisfied
with this, after a consultation with the leading men in the na-
tion, he determined to renew the solemn festivals which had,
unhappily, fallen into disuse ; and the ſeast of the passover was,
in consequence, kept with a splendour unknown since the days
of Solomon. Finally, he caused every graven image, or other
symbol of idolatry, throughout his dominions, to be destroyed,
involving in the common ruin, Moses' brazen serpent, which
the people had latterly been induced to worship; and putting
the priests in fresh courses, he restored to them and to the Le-
vites the tithes and first fruits, which his less worthy predeces.
sors had appropriated. In a word, Hezekiah exhibited, in all
his conduct, an extraordinaryº zeal for the true religion ; and
he was rewarded by numerous and striking interpositions of
divine power
in his favour.
While the Assyrians were employed in the subjugation of
Samaria, Hezekiah carried his arms, with signal success, against
the hereditary enemies of Judea, the Philistines. From these
he not only recovered all the conquests which they had made
during the late war with Pekah and Rezin, but pursuing his
conquests farther, dispossessed them of almost all their own
territories, except Gaza and Gath. Imboldened by so much
good fortune, and confident in the assistance of Jehovah, he
next refused to continue the tribute to the crown of Assyria,
which his father had undertaken to pay; and he was saved
i
from, at least, the immediate consequence of his courage, by
the necessity under which Shalmaneser lay of reducing certain
provinces of Syria and Phænicia, which had revolted from him.
Nor was the Assyrian monarch ever in a condition to accom-
plish his threat of hurling Hezekiah from the throne, inasmuch
as he died while carrying on the siege of Tyre, without having
brought that project to a successful termination.
About this time, Hezekiah was affected with a severe dis.
temper; and the prophet Isaiah came to him with a command
from God “to set his house in order, because he would surely
die." This was a mortifying announcement to an upright
prince, who, entertaining no correct notions of a futured state
of happiness, centred all his hopes and wishes in earthly pros-

perity; and he accordingly prayed with fervour and bitter en.
treaty, that Jehovah would not carry the sentence of death into
immediate execution. God was pleased to listen to the cry of
his faithful vicegerent, and again sent to him the prophet Isaiah,
who dressed the ulcer with which he was afflicted with a plaster
of figs, and restored him to health ; having previously caused
the shadow to go back upon the sundial ten full degrees, in tes.
timony that his simple remedy would prove effectual.
The pious king was scarcely recovered from his distemper,
when Sennacherib, who had succeeded his father, Shalmaneser,
on the throne of Assyria, advanced with a prodigious army
against him. Incapable of meeting in the field a force so over-
whelming, Hezekiah contented himself with throwing garrisons
into his fortified towns , putting Jerusalem in a state of defence,
and providing it with an ample supply of military stores, at the
same time that he despatched ambassadors to solicit the alliance
of So, king of Egypt, between whom and the Assyrian mon.
arch numerous grounds of hostility existed. The latter ar-
rangement, however, was highly disapproved by the prophet,
both as it implied a want of confidence in the protection of
Jehovah, and as a measure fraught with no good consequences:
and of the truth of the latter declaration, no great time elapsed
ere Hezekiah received the most convincing testimony. The
king of Egypt made no movement whatever to support him ;
and Hezekiah, finding that his towns were, one after another,
falling, was compelled to implore the clemency of Sennacherib,
and to promise a strict submission to such terms as he should
condescend to impose. But the demands of Sennacherib were
at once exceedingly grievous, and made with no honest intent.
He caused Hezekiah to pay a subsidy of three hundred talents
of silver, and thirty talents of gold ; to raise which, the good
king was compelled, not only to exhaustº his treasury, but to
strip, from the very doors of the temple, the gold with which
they were adorned ; and then, after a short truce, which he
himself spent in conducting an expedition into Ethiopia, he re-
newed his hostiled intentions towards Judea. For the second
time Sennacherib invested Lachish, a town of some importance
in South Judah, and sent thence three of his principal officers
to demand the surrender of Jerusalem itself.
It is not to be wondered at, if Hezekiah felt both alarmed
and distressed when the insolent and blasphemous messages of
which they were bearers, were delivered to him by the Assy-
rian generals. Hoping, however, that even now God would

not desert him, he carried Sennacherib's letter into the temple,
and spreading it before the altar, besought Jehovah to vindicate
his own honour, by humbling the pride of him who thus dared
to insult him. Hezekiah was not deceived in his expectations.
The prophet Isaiah came to him with a declaration that Sen.
nacherib should not be permitted, under any circumstances, to
accomplish his threats; and the promise was strictly fulfilled on
two separate occasions. In the first instance, Sennacherib,
while employed in the siege of Libnah, was alarmed by a ru-
mour that his own dominions had been invaded by a band of
Cuthite Arabians, to oppose whose progress he found it neces-
sary to march back with all haste ; and though he overthrew
them in a great battle, his second attempt upon Jerusalem
proved equally abortive, and more disastrous in its issue. He
arrived, indeed, in the vicinity of the city, took up his position
with great parade, and once more defied, by his heralds,“ the
living God;" but that very night the blast of the Simoom* came
upon
his
camp,
and upwards of eighty thousand of his bravest
soldiers perished. Sennacherib himself did not long survive
this defeat. He fled in dismay. to Nineveh, where he was soon
afterward murdered in the temple of the god Nisroch, by two
of his sons, who made their escape into Armenia, and left the
succession open to Esar-haddon, their younger brother.

And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold';
And the sheen of their spears', was like stars on the sea',
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee'.

Like the leaves of the forest', when autumn hath blown',

PSALM 137.
And there lay the steed', with his nostril all wide';
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride';
And the foam of his gasping', lay white on the turf',
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf'.
And there lay the rider', distorted and pale',
With the dew on his brow', and the rust on his mail;
And the tents were all silent', the banners', alone',
The lances', unlifted', the trumpet, unblown'.

And the widows of Asher' .. are loud in their wail';
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal';
And the might of the Gentile', unsmote by the sword',

us away captive', demanded of us a song'; and they that wasted
us', required of us mirth', saying', “Sing us one of the songs
of Zion'."
How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land'?
If I forget thee', o Jerusalem',, let my right hand forget her
cunning': If I do not remember thee', let my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth', if I prefer not Jerusalem above my

The beauteous teints that flush her skies';

That earth'--the proud', green earth'-has not',
With all the hues', and forms', and airs',

How willingly we turn us', then',
Away from this cold earth',
And look into thy azurea breast',
For seats of innocenceb and rest'!

The Musick of the Ocean.—Walsh's NATIONAL GAZETTE.
“And the people of this place say, that, at certain seasons, beautiful sounds are
heard from the ocean."-Mavor's Voyages.
LONELY and wild it rose,
That straine of solemn musick from the sea,
As though the bright air trembled to disclose
An ocean mystery.
Again a low, sweet tone,
Fainting in murmurs on the listening day,
Just bade the excited thought its presence own,
Then died away.
Once more the gush of sound,
Struggling and swelling from the heaving plain,
Thrilled a rich peal triumphantly around,
And fled again.

O, boundless deep! we know
Thou hast strange wonders in thy gloom concealed,
Gems, flashing gems, from whose unearthly glow
Sunlight is sealed.
And an eternal spring
Showers her rich colours with unsparing hand,
Where coral trees their graceful branches fling
O'er golden sand.
But tell, O, restless main!
Who are the dwellers in thy world beneath,
That thus the watery realm cannot contain
The joy they breathe ?
Emblem of glorious might!
Are thy wild children like thyself arrayed,
Strong in immortal and unchecked delight,
Which cannot fade?
Or to mankind allied,
Toiling with wo, and passion's fiery sting,
Like their own home, where storms or peace preside,
As the winds bring ?
Alas, for human thought !
How does it flee existence, worn and old,
To win companionship with beings wrought
Of finer mould!

Join with loud revel the dim ages flown,
But keep each secret of their hidden caves
Dark and unknown.

Colloquial Powers of Dr. Franklin.--WIRT.
NEVER have I known such a fireside companion'. Great as
he was', both as a statesman' and a philosopher', he never shone
in a light more winning than when he was seen in a domestick
circle'. It was once my good fortune to pass two or three
weeks with him', at the house of a private gentleman', in the
back part of Pennsylvania'; and we were confined to the house
during the whole of that time', by the unintermitting constancy
and depth of the snows'. But confinement could never be felt
where Franklin was an inmate'. His cheerfulness and his
colloquial powers spread around him a perpetual spring. When
I speak', however', of his colloquial powers', I do not mean to
awaken any notion analogous to that which Boswell has given
us when he so frequently mentions the colloquial powers of Dr.
Johnson'. The conversation of the latter continually reminds
one of “the pomp and circumstance of glorious war'.” It was',
indeed', a perpetual contest for victory', or an arbitrary and
despotick exaction of homage to his superiour talents'. It was
strong', acute', prompt', splendid', and vociferous'; as loud',
stormy, and sublime' as those winds which he represents as
shaking the Hebrides', and rocking the old castles that frowned
upon the dark-rolling sea beneath'. But one gets tired of storms',
however sublime they may be', and longs for the more orderly
current of nature'.-Of Franklin', no one ever became tired'.
There was no ambition of eloquence', no effort to shine',
in any thing which came from him'. There was nothing
which made any demand either upon your allegiance' or your
admiration'.
His manner was as unaffected as infancy'. It was nature's
self. He talked like an old patriarch';º and his plainness and
simplicity put you', at once', at your ease', and gave you the
full and free possession and use of all your faculties'.
His thoughts were of a character to shine by their own light',

without any adventitious aid'. They required only a medium
of vision like his pure and simple style', to exhibit';' to the
highest advantage', their native radiance and beauty'. His
cheerfulness was unremitting. It seemed to be as much the
effect of a systematick and salutary exercise of the mind', as of
its superiour organization'. His wit was of the first order'. It
did not show itself merely in occasional coruscations'; but',
without any effort or force on his part', it shed a constante
stream of the purest light over the whole of his discourse'.
Whether in the company of commons or nobles', he was
always the same', plain man'; always most perſectly at his
ease', with his faculties in full play', and the full orbit of his
genius forever clear and unclouded'. And then', the stores of
his mind were inexhaustible'. He had commenced life with an
attention so vigilant', that nothing had escaped his observation',
and a judgment so solid', that every incident was turned to
advantage. His youth had not been wasted in idleness', nor
overcast by intemperance'. He had been all his life a close and
deep reader', as well as thinker'; and', by the force of his
own powers', had wrought up the raw materials which he had
gathered from books', with such exquisite skill and felicity', that
he had added a hundred fold to their original value', and justly
made them his own'.

Intellectual Qualities of Milton.-CHANNING.
In speaking of the intellectual qualities of Milton, we may
begin by observing that the very splendour of his poetick fame,
has tended to obscure or conceal the extent of his mind, and the
variety of its energies and attainments. To many, he seems
only a poet, when, in truth, he was a profound scholar, a man
of vast compass of thought, imbued thoroughly with all ancienta
and modern learning, and able to master, to mould, to impreg.
nate with his own intellectual power, his great and various
acquisitions. He had not learned the superficial doctrine of a
later day, that poetry flourishes most in an uncultivated soil,
and that imagination shapes its brightest visions from the mists
of a superstitious age; and he had no dread of accumulating
knowledge lest he should oppress and smother his genius. He

INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES OF MILTON. 209
was conscious of that within him, which could quicken all
knowledge, and wield it with ease and might; which could give
freshness to old truths, and harmony to discordant thoughts ;
which could bind together, by living ties and mysterious affini-
ties, the most remote discoveries ; and rear fabricks of glory
and beauty from the rude materials which other minds had
collected.
Milton had that universality which marks the highest order
of intellect. Though accustomed, almost from infancy, to drink
at the fountains of classical literature, he had nothing of the
pedantry and fastidiousness which disdain all other draughts.
His healthy mind delighted in genius, in whatever soil, or in
whatever age it might have burst forth, and poured out its ful.
He understood too well the right, and dignity, and pride
of creative imagination, to lay on it the laws of the Greek or
Roman school. Parnassus was not to him the only holy ground
of genius. He felt that poetry was a universal presence. Great
minds were everywhere his kindred. He felt the enchantment
of oriental fiction, surrendered himself to the strange creations
of “ Araby the blest," and delighted still more in the romantick
spirit of chivalry, and in the tales of wonder in which it was
imbodied. Accordingly, his poetry reminds us of the ocean,
which adds to its own boundlessness, contributions from all
regions under heaven.
Nor was it only in the department of imagination, that his
acquisitions were vast. He travelled over the whole field of
knowledge, as far as it had then heen explored. His various
philological attainments were used to put him in possession of
the wisdom stored in all countries where the intellect had been
cultivated. The natural philosophy, metaphysicks, ethicks,
history, theology, and political science of his own and former
times, were familiar to him. Never was there a more unconfined
mind; and we would cite Milton as a practical example of the
benefits of that universal cultured of intellect, which forms one
distinction of our times, but which some dread as unfriendly to
original thought. Let such remember, that mind is, in its own
nature, diffusive. Its object is the universe, which is strictly
one, or bound together by infinite connexions and correspond-
encies; and, accordingly, its natural progress is from one field of
thought to another, and wherever original power or creative
genius exists, the mind, far from being distracted or oppressed
by the variety of its acquisitions, will see more and more bear.

SECTION IV.
Moral and Intellectual Efficacy of the Sacred Scriptures.
WAYLAND.
As to the powerful', I had almost said', miraculous', effect
of the Sacred Scriptures', there can no longer be a doubt in the
mind of any one on whom fact can make an impression'. That
the truths of the Bible have the power of awakening an intense
moral feeling in man under every variety of character', learned',
or ignorant', civilized', or savage'; that they make bad men
good', and send a pulse of healthful feeling through all the do-
mestick', civil', and social relations'; that they teach men to
love right', to hate wrong', and to seek each other's welfare',
as the children of one common parent'; that they control the
baleful passions of the human heart',. . and thus make men
proficients in the science of self-government';" and', finally',
that they teach him to aspire after a conformity to a Being of
infinite holiness', and fill him with hopes infinitely more puri.
fying', more exalting', more suited to his nature';' than any
other which this world has ever known',-are facts as incon.
trovertible as the laws of philosophy', or the demonstrations
of mathematicks'. Evidence in support of all this', can be
brought from every age in the history of man', since there has
been a revelation from God on earth. We see the proof of it
everywhere around us'. There is scarcely a neighbourhood
in our country', where the Bible is circulated', in which we
cannot point to a very considerable portion of its population',
which its truths have reclaimed from the practice of vice', and
taught the practice of whatsoever things are pure', and honest,
and just', and of good report'.
That this distinctive and peculiar effect is produced upon
every man to whom the gospel is announced', we pretend not to
affirm'. But we do affirm', that', besides producing this special
renovation to which we have alluded', upon a part', in a most
remarkable degree', it elevates the tone of moral feeling through-
out the whole community'. Wherever the Bible is freely cir.
culated', and its doctrines carried home to the understandings
of men', the aspect of society is altered'; the frequency of
crime is diminished'; men begin to love justice', and to admin
ister it by law'; and a virtuous', publick opinion', that strongest
safeguard of right', spreads over a nation the shield of its in-

visible protection'. Wherever it has faithfully been brought to
bear upon the human heart', even under the most unpromising
circumstances', it has', within a single generation', revolution-
ized the whole structure of society'; and thus', within a few
years', done more for man than all other means have accom-
plished for ages', without it'. For proof of all this', I need
only refer you to the effects of the Gospel in Greenland', or in
South Africa', in the Society Islands', or even among the
aborigines of our own country':
But', before we leave this part of the subject', it may be well
to pause for a moment',, and inquire whether', in addition to
its moral efficacy', the Bible may not exert a powerful influence
upon the intellectual character of man'.
And here it is scarcely necessary that I should remark', that',
of all the books with which', since the invention of writing',
this world has been deluged', the number of those is very
small
which have produced any perceptible effect on the mass of man.
kind'. By far the greater part have been', even by their cotem.
poraries', unnoticed and unknown'. Now and then one has
made its little mark upon the generation that produced it', and
then', with that generation', has sunk to utter forgetfulness'.
But', after the ceaseless toil of six thousand years', how few
have been the works', the adamantine basis of whose reputation
has stood unhurt amid the fluctuations of time', and whose im-
pression can be traced', in the history of our species', through
successive centuries'.
When', however', such a work appears', its effects are abso-
lutely incalculable'; and such a work', you are aware', is the
ILIAD OF HOMER'. Who can estimate the results produced by
the incomparable efforts of a single mind'? Who can tell what
Greece owes to this first-born of song'? Her breathing mar-
bles', her solemn temples', her unrivalled eloquence', and her
matchless verse', all point us to that transcendent genius', who',
by the very splendour of his own effulgence', awoke the human
intellect from the slumber of ages'. It was Homer who gave
laws to the artist'; it was Homer who inspired the poet'; it was
Homer who thundered in the senate'; and', more than all', it
was Homer who was sung by the people'; and hence', a nation
was cast into the mould of one mighty mind'; and the land of
the Iliad became the region of taste', the birth-place of the
arts'.
Nor was this influence confined within the limits of Greecel.
Long after the sceptre of empire had passed westward', Genius

still held her court on the banks of the Ilissus', and', from the
country of Homer', gave laws to the world'. The light which
the blind old man of Scio had kindled in Greece', shed its ra-
diance over Italy'; and thus did he awaken a second nation
into intellectual existence'. And we may form some idea of
the power which this one work'; to the present day', has
exerted over the mind of man', by remarking', that “nation
after nation', and century after century', have been able to do
little more than transpose his incidents', new-name his charac.
ters', and paraphrase his sentiments'."
But', considered simply as an intellectual production', who
will compare the poemse of Homer with the Holy Scriptures
of the Old and New Testament? Where', in the Iliad', shall
we find simplicity and pathos which shall vie with the narra-
tive of Moses', or maxims of conduct to equal in wisdom the
Proverbs of Solomon', or sublimity which doesd. not fade away
before the conceptions of Job', or David', of Isaiah', or St.
John'? But I cannot pursue this comparison'. I feel that it
is doing wrong to the mind which dictated the Iliad', and to
those other mighty intellects on whom the light of the holy
oracles never shined'. Who that has réad Homer's great
poem', has not observed how he strove in vain to give dignity
to the mythology of his time'? Who has not seen how the
religion of his country', unable to support the flight of his
imagination', sunk powerless beneath him? It is in the unseen
world where the master spirits of our race breathe freely', and
are at home'; and it is mournful to behold the intellect of Ho.
mer', striving to free itself from the conceptions of materialism',
and then sinking down in hopeless despair', to weave idle tales
about Jupiter and Juno', Apollo and Diana'. But the difficul-
ties under which he laboured', are abundantly illustrated by the
fact, that the light which he poured upon the human intellect',
taught other ages how unworthy was the religion of his day',
and of the man who was compelled to use it'.

afflicted', death is the termination of evils'; but he makes not

If', then', so great results have flowed from this one effort

efforts of several', at least', his equals in power over the human

Master', who did sin', this man', or his parents'," that he was
born blind'? Jesus answered', Neither hath this man sinned',
nor his parents':- but', that the works of God should be made
manifest in him'. I must work the works of him that sent
me', while it is day': the night cometh when no man can work'.
As long as I am in the world', I am the light of the world'.
When he had thus spoken', he spit on the ground', and
made clay of the spittle', and anointed the eyes of the blind
man with the clay', and said unto him', Go', wash in the pool
of Siloam', (which is', by interpretation', Sent'.) He went his
way', therefore', and washed', and came'. . sêèing'.

How were thine eyes opened'? He answered and said', A man
that is called Jesus', made clay', and anointed mine eyes', and
said unto me', Go to the pool of Siloam', and wash'. And I
went and washed', and I received my sight'. Then said they
unto him', Where is he'? He said', I know not'.
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind'.
And it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay', and

him how he had received his sight'. He said unto them', He

because he keepeth not the Sabbath day'. Others said', How
can a man that is a sinner', do such miracles'?
And there was
a division among them'.
They say unto the blind man again', What sayest thou of
him', that he hath opened thine eyes'?. He said', He is a
prophet'. But the Jews did not believe concerning him', that
he had been blind', and received his sight', until they called
the parents of him that had received his sight'. And they
asked them', saying', Is this your son' who', ye say', was born
Blind'? How then dothº he now sêè'? His parents answered
them and said', We know that this is our sôn', and that he was
born blind': but by what means he now seeth', we know not';
or who hath opened his eyes', we know not'. He is of age':
ask him. He shall speak for himself":
'
These words spake his parents', because they feared the
Jews': for the Jews had agreed already', that if any man did
confess that he was Christ', he should be put out of the syna.
gogue'. Therefore? said his parents', He is of age': ask him'.
Then again" called they the man that had been blind', and
said unto him', Give God the praise': we know that this man
is a sinner'. He answered and said', Whether he is a sinner
or not', I do not knôw': one thing I know', that', whereas', I
was blind', now I sêê'.
Then said they to him again', What did he to thee'?-how
opened he thine eyes'? He answered them', I have told you
already', and ye did not hear': Wherefore would ye hear it
again?" will ye also be his disciples'?
Then they reriled him',' and said', Thou art his disciple';
but we are Moses' disciples'. We know that God spake unto
Moses'; as for this fellow', we know not whence he is'. The
man answered and said unto them', Why', herein is a marvel.
lous thing', that ye know not whence he is', and yet', he hath
opened mine eyes'. Now we know that God heareth not sin-
ners': but if any man be a worshipper of God', and doeth his
will, him he heareth'. Since the world begân has it not been
heard that a man opened the eyes of one that was born blind'.
If this man were not of God', he could do nothing'. They
answered and said unto him', Thou wast altogether born in
sins', and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out'.

SECTION VI.
Industry necessary to the Attainment of Eloquence.-WARE.
The history of the world is full of testimony to prove how
much depends upon industry. Not an eminent orator has lived
but is an example of it. Yet, in contradiction to all this, the
almost universal feeling appears to be, that industry can effect
nothing, that eminence is the result of accident, and that every
one must be content to remain just what he may happen to be.
Thus, multitudes, who come forward as teachers and guides,
suffer themselves to be satisfied with the most indifferent at.
tainments, and a miserable mediocrity, without so much as
inquiring how they may rise higher, much less, making any
attempt to rise. For any other art they would have served an
apprenticeship, and would be ashamed to practise it in publick
before they had learned it. If any one would sing, he attends
a master, and is drilled in the very elementary principles; and
it is only after the most laborious process that he dares to exer-
cise his voice in publick. This he docs, though he has scarcely
any thing to learn but the mechanical execution of what lies in
sensible forms before the eye. But the extempore speaker,
who is to invent, as well as to utter, to carry on an operation
of the mind, as well as to produce sound, enters upon the work
without preparatory discipline, and then wonders that he fails !
If he were learning to play on the flute for publick exhibition,
how many hours and days would he spend in giving facility to
his fingers, and in attaining the power of the sweetest and
most expressive execution ! If he were devoting himself to the
organ, how many months and years would he labour, that he

might know its compass, and become master of its keys, and
be able to draw out, at will, all its various combinations of har.
monious sound, and its full richness and delicacy of expression !
And yet, he will fancy that the grandest, the most various, and
the most expressive of all instruments an instrument which
the infinite Creator has fashioned by the union of an intellectual
soul with the powers of speech, may be played upon without
study or practice. He comes to it a mere, uninstructed tyro,
and thinks, at once, to manage all its stops, and command the
whole compass of its varied and comprehensive power! He
finds himself a bungler in the attempt; is mortified at his
failure, and settles it in his mind forever, that the attempt is
unavailing.
Success in every art, whatever may be the natural talent, is
always the reward of industry and pains. But the instances
are many, of men, of the finest natural genius, whose be.
ginnings have promised much, but who have wretchedly degen-
erated as they advanced, because they trusted to their gifts, and
made no efforts to improve upon them. That there have never
been other men of equal endowments with Demosthenes and
Cicero, none would venture to suppose; but who have so de.
voted themselves to their art, or who have become their equals
in excellence ? If those great men had been like others, con.
tent to continue as they began, and had never made their per-
severing efforts for improvement, what would their countries
have been benefited by their genius, or the world have known
of their fame? They would have been lost in the undistin.
guished crowd that sunk to oblivion around them. Of how
many more will the same remark prove true; and what en.
couragement, is thus given to the industrious! With such
encouragement, then, how inexcusable is that negligence which
suffers the most interesting and important truths to seem heavy
and dull, and fall ineffectual to the ground, through mere slug-
gishness in their delivery! How unworthy of one who per-
forms the high functions of a religious instructer, upon whom
depend, in a great measure, the religious knowledge, and de-
votional sentiments, and final character, of many fellow-beings,
to imagine, that he can worthily discharge this great concern,
by occasionally talking for an hour, he knows not how, and in
a manner which he has taken no pains to render correct, im.
pressive, and attractive; and which, merely through want of
that command over himself which study would give, is im.

methodical, verbose, inaccurate, feeble, trifling! It has been
said of the good preacher, that “truths divine come mended
from his tongue.” Alas! they come ruined and worthless from
such a man as the one here described. They lose that holy
energy, by which they are to convert the soul and purify man
for heaven, and sink, in interest and efficacy, below the level of
those principles which govern the ordinary affairs of this lower
world.

On Eloquence.-WIRT.
TELL me', then', you who are capable of doing it', what is
this divine eloquence'? What the charm by which the orator
binds the senses of his audience';-by which he attunes', and
touches', and sweeps the human lyre', with the resistless sway'
and master hand of a Timotheus'? Is not the whole mystery
comprehended in one word'.. SYMPATHY'? I mean', not
merely that tender passion which quavers the lip', and fills the
eye', of the babe when it looks on the sorrows and tears of
another', but that still more delicate and subtile quality by which
we passively catch the very colours', momentum', and strength
of the mind to whose operations we are attending'; which con.
verts every speaker to whom we listen', into a Procrustes', and
enables him', for the moment', to stretch or lop our faculties to
fit the standard of his own mind'.
If there is not something of this secret intercourse from spirit
to spirit', how does it happen that one speaker shall gradually
invade and benumb all the faculties of my soul', as if I were
handling a torpedo'; while another shall awaken and arouse
me', like the clangour of the martial trumpet'? How does it
happen', that the first shall infuse his poor spirit into my system',
lethargize my native intellect', and bring down my powers
exactly to the level of his own'? or that the last shali descend
upon me like an angel of light', breathe new energies into my
frame', dilate my soul with his own intelligence', exalt me
into a new and nobler region of thought', snatch me from
the earth at pleasure', and wrap me to the seventh heaven'?
And', what is still more wonderful', how does it happen that
these different effects endure so long after the agency of the
speaker has ceased'? insomuch', that if', after listening to the
first speaker', I sit down to any intellectual exercise', my per-
formance shall be unworthy even of me', and the numb-fish

visible and tangible in every sentence': whereas',if', after having
attended to the last mentioned orator', I enter on
amusement', I shall be astonished at the elevation and vigour of
my own thoughts'; and', if I accidentally meet with the same
production a month or two afterward', when my mind has lost
the inspiration', I shall scarcely be able to recognise it for my
own work'?
Whence is all this? To me it would seem', that it must pro-
ceed', either from the subtile commerce between the spirits of
men', which lord Verulam notices', and which enables the speaker
thereby to identify his hearer with himself", or else', that the
mind of man possesses', independent of any volition on the part
of its proprietor', a species of pupillary faculty of dilating and
contracting itself', in proportion to the pencil of the rays of
light which the speaker throws upon it'; which dilation or con-
traction', as in the case of the eye', cannot be immediately and
abruptly altered'
Whatever may be the solution', the fact', I think', is certainly
as I have stated it': and it is remarkable that the same effect is
produced', though perhaps in a less degree', by perusing books
into which different degrees of spirit and genius have been
infused'. I am acquainted with a gentleman who never sits
down to a composition in which he wishes to shine', without
previously reading', with intense application', half a dozen pages
of his favourite Bolingbroke'. Having taken the character and
impulse of that writer's mind', he declares that he feels his pen
flow with a spirit not his own'; and that', if', in the course
of his work', his powers begin to languish', he finds it easy
to revive and charge them afresh from the same never-failing
source'.
If these things are not visionary', it becomes important to a
man', for a new reason', what books he reads', and what com-
pany he keeps', since', according to lord Verulam's notion', an
influx of the spirits of others', may change the native character
of his heart and understanding', before he is aware of it'; or',
according to the other suggestion', he may so habitually contract
the pupil of his mind', as to be disqualified for the comprehen-
sion of a great subject', and fit only for microscopick observa-
tions'. Whereas', by keeping the company', and reading the
works', of men of magnanimity and genius only', he may
receive their qualities by subtile transmission', and eventually
get the eye', the ardour', and the enterprise of an eagle'.

mitting the correctness of the principles first mentioned', it

would seem to be a fair conclusion', that whenever an orator
wishes to know what effect he has produced on his audience',
he should coolly and conscientiously propound to himself this
question': Have I myself, throughout my oration', felt those
clear and cogent convictions of judgment, and that pure and
exalted fire of the soul', with which I wished to inspire others'?
For', he may rely upon it', that he can no more impart or (to
use lord Bacon's word,) transmit convictions and sensations
which he himself has not', at the time', sincerely felt', than he
can convey a clear title to property in which he himself has no
right'.
This leads me to point out a fault which I have often noticed'.
Following up too closely the cold conceit of the Roman division
of an oration', some speakers set aside a particular part of their
discourse', (usually the peroration',) in which they take it into
their heads that they will be pathetick'. Accordingly', when
they reach this part', whether it be prompted by the feelings or
not', a mighty bustle commences'. The speaker pricks up his
ears', erects his chest', tosses his arms with hysterical vehe.
mence', and says everything which he supposes ought to affect
his hearers', but it is all in vain': for it is obvious that every
thing he says is prompted by the head'; and', however it may
display his ingenuity and fertility', however it may appeal to the
admiration of his hearers', it will never strike deeper'. The
hearts of the audience will reſuse all commerce except with the
heart of the speaker'; nor', in this commerce', is it possible', by
any disguise however artſul', to impose false ware upon them'.
However the speaker may labour to seem to feel', however near
he may approach to the appearance of the reality', the heart',
nevertheless', possesses a keen', unerring sense which never
fails to detect the imposture'. It would seem as if the heart of
man stamps a secret mark on all its effusions', which alone can
give them currency', and which no ingenuity', however adroit',
can successfully counterfeit'.
I have been not a little diverted in listening to some of these
fine orators who deal almost entirely in this pathos of the head'.
They practise the start', the pause'-make an immense parade
of attitudes and gestures', and seem to imagine themselves
piercing the heart with a thousand wounds'. The heart', all the
time', developing every trick that is played off to cajole her',
and sitting serene and composed', looks on -and smiles at the
ridiculous pageanta as it passes'.

Nothing', in my opinion', can be more ill-judged in an orator',

SECTION VIII.
Caspar Hauser.
The following sketch of this extraordinary and ill-fated youth, is extracted from
an account given of him by ANSELM VON FEUERBACH, President of one of the
Bavarian courts of appeal---translated by H. G. LINBERG, and published at
Boston, by ALLEN & TICKNOR, 1832.
On the 26th of May, 1828, towards the close of the day, a
citizen of Nuremberg, (in Franconia,) who lived near the small
and unfrequented Haller gate, and who was, at the time, loiter.
ing before his door, observed at a short distance, a young man
in a peasant's dress. He was standing in a very singular posture,
and, apparently like one intoxicated, was endeavouring to walk,
but without the ability to keep himself erect, or to govern the
movement of his legs. The citizen approached the stranger,
who held out to him a letter, directed “To the captain of the
4th Esgataren of the Shwoliskay regiment, Nuremberg.".
The captain referred to, lived near the New gate ; and, though
not without much difficulty, thither the citizen conducted the
strange youth. On entering the captain's mansion, the stranger
advanced towards the servant that had opened the door, with
his hat on his head, and the letter in his hand, addressing him
in a jargon of indistinct and almost altogether inarticulate sounds,
the meaning of which no one could comprehend. The servant
asked him what he wanted; who he was; and whence he
came; but the stranger appeared to understand none of these
interrogatories, his only reply being, "Ae sechtene möcht ich
nehn,” &c. : the same unintelligible jargon he had previously
uttered when accosted by the citizen who accompanied him.
The young man was so much fatigued as scarcely to be able to
walk or stand. Weeping, and with an expression of excessive

pain, he pointed to his feet, which were sinking under him. He
appeared, also, to be suffering from hunger and thirst., A small
piece of meat was, therefore, offered him; but the first morsel
had scarce touched his lips, before he shuddered, the muscles of
his face being, at the same time, seized with spasms; and, with
visible horrour, he spit it out. On tasting a few drops of beer
that was presented to him, he likewise showed the same marks
of : aversion. But a bit of bread, and a glass of water, he
swallowed greedily, and with great satisfaction. In the mean
time, all attempts to gain any information respecting his person,
his arrival, or his residence, were altogether fruitless. His lan-
guage consisted of tears, moans, and unintelligible sounds, or
of an awkward attempt at the words already mentioned.
In the captain's house, he was taken for a kind of demi.
savage. The captain knew nothing of the stranger; nor could
he learn anything concerning him from the letter which he had
brought, any more than by questioning him. For a develop.
ment of the mystery which hung over the character and pur-
poses of this singular being, as well as for the care of his
person, he was, therefore, consigned over to the city police.
His journey to the police-office, in his pitiable situation, (for, it
afterward proved, that this was about his first attempt at
walking, and the first time he had worn shoes or boots; and,
moreover, that the boots he then had on, had excoriated and
sorely blistered his feet,) was almost a course of martyrdom, and
not accomplished but with the greatest difficulty.
At the guard-room, he was equally looked upon as a most
extraordinary phenomenon. The attempt to examine him by
questions, proved altogether unavailing. A repetition of the
sounds, “ Ae reuta waehn,” &c. (to which sounds he himself, as
was afterward ascertained, attached not the shadow of a mean-
ing) were the only sounds or words which, on the most diverse
occasions, he uttered. He appeared neither to know, nor to
consider, where he was. He betrayed neither astonishment,
fear, nor confusion; but rather showed that kind of insensibility,
or brutish dulness, which either leaves external objects entirely
unnoticed, or gazes at them without thought, and suffers them to
pass without being affected by them. His tears and whimpering,
while he was frequently pointing to his tortured and tottering
feet, together with his awkward and child-like demeanour, soon
excited the compassion of all who were present. A soldier
offered him a piece of meat and a glass of beer ; but these, in
ather'fore. "De-vélůp-ment-not, munt. «Po-ldés'. As-tbnish.

a
the same manner as at the captain's house, he rejected with
shuddering and abhorrence. Another gave him a piece of coin.
At this he expressed the joy of a little child; and, in short, his
whole conduct and demeanour seemed to be that of a child
scarcely two years old, although he possessed the stature of a
young man.
The police, not knowing whether to consider him an idiot, a
madman, or a savage, or whether, under the guise of a stupid
boy, some cunning deceiver might not be concealed, sent him
to the tower of the Vestner gate, a place used for the confine-
ment of
rogues
and vagabonds.
The name, CASPAR HAUSER, he wore upon his hat, when
first discovered in Nuremberg. His dress was very shabby,
though evidently not that of a peasant, nor one made for him.
self. His pockets were stuffed with religious manuscripts and
books. The letter which he carried in his hand, was written,
a part in German characters, and a part in Latin; but, instead
of giving any satisfactory information concerning him, it seemed
purposely penned with a view to render still more difficult the
solution of the dark enigma which Caspar presented in his own
person. It purported to be written by a female; stated that
Caspar was 17 years old; and that he wished to become a
soldier.
On his first appearance in Nuremberg, Caspar was only four
feet and nine inches in height; but his stature soon rapidly
increased. His complexion was fair; his limbs were delicately
formed ; his hands small and beautifully shaped ; and the soles
of his feet, as well as the palms of his hands, were as soft as
those of an infant; but his countenance lacked animation and
expression; and the staring look of his clear and bright blue
eyes, betrayed an infantile inanity. If any thing pleasant,
however, affected his mind, a smiling, heart-winning sweetness
diffused itself over his features, and lighted up his countenance
with that irresistible charm which alone is revealed by the joy
of an innocent child. He knew but little better how to use his
hands and fingers, than he did his legs and feet. In taking
hold of any thing, he employed the tips of his first finger and
thumb, with the others stretched out stiff and straight, in the
uncouth and awkward manner of a little child that has not yet
learned to handle things. His gait, like that of an infant making
its first essays in leading-strings, was, properly speaking, not a
walk, but rather a waddling, tottering, groping of his way-a
painful medium between the motion of falling, and of endeavour.

ing to keep himself upright. In attempting to walk, instead of
first treading firmly on his heel, as persons commonly do, he
placed his heels and the balls of his feet simultaneously upon
the ground; and, instead of lifting only one foot at a time, he
would endeavour to raise both at once. In this miserably awk.
ward manner, he toddled and stumbled slowly and heavily
forward, with arms stiff and stretched out, which he seemed to
use as balance-poles. The slightest impediment caused him to
fall flat on the floor: and for a long time after his arrival, he
could not go up or down stairs without assistance.
SECTION XI.
Caspar Hauser-Continued.
The surprise and wonder excited by Caspar Hauser's first
appearance in Nuremberg, soon settled down into the form of a
dark and horrid enigma, to explain which, various conjectures
were resorted to. By no means an idiot or a madman, he was
so mild, so obedient, and so good-natured, that no one could any
longer regard this forlorn and forsaken stranger as a savage, or
a child grown up among the wild beasts of the forest. And
yet, he was so destitute of words and conceptions, so unac-
quainted with the most common objects and operations of nature,
and showed so great an indifference, nay, abhorrence, to all
the ordinary customs, conveniences, and necessaries of life, and,
moreover, evinced peculiarities so extraordinaryd in all the char-
acteristicks of his mental, moral, physical, and social being, as
seemed to leave no other choice than to regard him, either as an
inhabitant of some other planet, miraculously transferred to
the earth,' or as one who like the ideal man of Plato) had been
born and bred under ground, and who, having arrived at the age
of maturity, had now, for the first time, emerged from his sub-
terranean abode, and ascended to the surface of the earth to
behold the light of the sun.
Caspar continued to show the greatest aversion to all kinds
of food and drink, except dry bread and water. Without swal.
lowing, or even tasting, them, the very smell of most kinds of
common food, was sufficient to make him shudder, or even to
affect him still more disagreeably. The least drop of wine,

coffee, or the like, secretly mixed with the water which he drank,
produced in him cold sweats, or caused him to be seized with
vomiting or violent headache. A person once attempted to force
upon him some brandy, under a pretence that it was water; but
the glass had scarcely reached his lips, when he turned pale,
sunk down, and would have fallen backward against a glass
door, had he not been instantlyä supported. Even milk, whether
boiled or fresh, he could not bear. At one time, some meat
being concealed in his bread, he smelled it immediately, and
expressed a great aversion to it; but being prevailed on to eat
it, extreme illness followed as the consequence.
During the
night, which, with him, commenced regularly with the setting,
and ended with the rising, of the sun, he lay upon his bed of
straw; and in the day-time, he sat upon the floor, with his legs
stretched out straight before him. When, for the first time, a
lighted candle was placed before him, he was delighted with the
shining flame, and unsuspectingly put his fingers into it; but
he soon drew them back, crying out and weeping. In order to
try their effect upon him, feigned cuts and thrusts with a naked
sabre, were made at him ; but he remained immovable, without
even winking: nor did he seem to harbour the least suspicion
that any harm could thus be done to him. On placing a looking-
glass before him, he caught at his own reflected image, and then
looked behind it in order to find the person whom he imagined
was concealed there. Like a little child, he endeavoured to lay
hold of every glittering object he saw; and when he could not
reach it, or when forbidden to touch it, he wept. Of ordinary
transactions which passed before his eyes, he took not the least
notice; but when objects were brought very near him, he gazed
at them with a vacant look, which, in many instances, was
expressive of curiosity and astonishment. His whole vocabu-
lary contained only two words. Whatever partook of the human
form, he called, without any distinction of sex or age, bua
and to every animal he met with, whether quadruped or biped,
whether dog, cat, goose, or fowl, he gave the name of ross; a
term which, as was afterward ascertained, in his dictionary,
meant horse. With white horses, he appeared to be greatly
pleased; but black animals were regarded by him with aversion
and fear. The sight of a black hen advancing towards him,
once put him in so great fear, that he cried out lustily; and,
notwithstanding his feet refused to perform their office, he made
every effort in his power to run away from her.

peared, at first, to be in a state of torpor, from which they
were aroused, and opened up to the perception of external
objects, only by slow degrees. It was not before the lapse of
several days, that he began to notice the striking of the town
clock, and the ringing of bells. These sounds excited in him
the most profound astonishment, which was, at first, expressed
only by listening looks, and peculiar spasmodick motions of the
muscles of his face; but these were soon succeeded by a stare
of benumbed meditation. Some weeks after, a band of musick
passed by the tower, close under his window. On hearing it,
he suddenly stood listening, motionless as a statué. His coun.
tenance appeared to be transfigured, and his eyes, as it were, to
radiate his ecstasy; his ears - and eyes seemed to follow the
movements of the sounds as they receded and died away in the
distance;" and, when they had long ceased to be audible to
others, as if unwilling to lose the last vibrations of these, to
him, celestial notes, or as if his soul had followed them, and left
its body behind it in a state of torpid insensibility. Future de.
velopments clearly illustrated, however, that, by his extraordi-
nary and almost superhuman acuteness of hearing, he actually
heard, in this instance, the sounds, long after they had become
inaudible to common ears.
Among the remarkable phenomena which appeared in Cas-
par's conduct, it was soon observed that the idea of horses, and,
particularly, of wooden horses, was one which, in his estimation,
must have acquired no small degree of importance. The word
ross, he pronounced more frequentlyd than any other, and on
the most diverse occasions : sometimes, indeed, with tears in his
eyes, and in a plaintive, beseeching tone. This suggested the
idea of presenting him with the toy of a wooden horse. Caspar,
а
who had hitherto been much dejected, appeared now to be, as it
were, suddenly transformed, and conducted himself as if he had
found, in this little horse, an old and long-desired friend. With
a countenance smiling, and in tears, he immediately seated
himself on the floor, by the side of his inanimate friend, stroked
it, patted it, kept his eyes immovably fixed upon it, and endea-
voured to hang upon it all the variegated, glittering trifles with
which the benevolence of his visiters had supplied him; and it
was only thus applied, that, in his estimation, these trinkets
appeared to have acquired their true value. On account of his
peculiar partiality for wooden horses, he was soon supplied with
several, which henceforward became his constant companions

and playmates. With them he constantly employed himself,
either in decorating them with trinkets, or in dragging them
backwards and forwards by his side. He never ate his bread
without first holding every morsel of it to the mouth of one of
his horses ; nor did he ever drink water without first dipping
their mouths into it; for as yet, in his infantile soul, ideas of
things animate and inanimate, organick and inorganick, natural
and artificial, were strangely mingled together.
He distinguished animals from man only by their form, and
men from women only by their dress : and, on account of its
varied and lively colours, the apparel of females was far more
pleasing to him than that of males. He therefore expressed a
desire to become a girl ; or, in other words, to wear women's
clothes. That children should become grown people, was alto-
gether inconceivable to him. No idea of a God, no idea of a
spiritual existence-not a spark of religion, not the least particle
of any dogmatick system, was to be found in his mind; but, as
yet, it was a perfect blank sheet, on which the first impressions
were to be made. Although by no means an idiot, nor one
that had been neglected by nature, yet, innumerable proofs
were not wanting to show, that, with the age and physical
powers and proportions of a man, he had the mind only of an
infant-that, in some mysterious and inconceivable manner, he
must have been deprived of all the ordinary means of giving
development and culture' to his intellectual powers. His whole
demeanour was a perfect mirror of child-like innocence. There
was nothing deceitful in him. His expressions (as far as the
poverty of his language would admit) exactly corresponded
with the dictates of his heart.
In a few days after his arrival at the tower, Caspar was no
longer considered as a prisoner, but as a forsaken and neglected
child, that needed to be cared for and educated. Accordingly,
he was soon taught to speak and write, and to begin to lay in a
stock of useful ideas adapted to his infantile conception; and
when his mind had been once directed to more important occu.
pations, he no longer took delight in his playthings. Curiosity
soon brought multitudes to see him. Some, indeed, regarded
him only as an object of wonder and amusement ;d yet others
conversed with him rationally, and endeavoured, by pronouncing
words which they made him repeat, and by signs, and ges-
tures, and various other means, to make unknown things
known to him, and to awaken his mind to the conception and

communication of ideas. Every thing he saw or heard, was, at
first, entirely new to him, and supplied him with new materials
of thought, and tended to increase his slender stock of ideas.
About a fortnight after the arrival of Caspar in Nuremberg,
he was fortunately placed with professor Daumer, an accom.
plished scholar, and an intelligent and humane man, who, in
the kindly feelings of his heart, agreed to take upon himself the
important task of instructing the unfortunate youth. To the
extraordinary abilities of this benevolent gentleman, was. Cas.
par, in no small degree, indebted for that rapid development of
his active mind, that insatiable thirst for knowledge, that fer-
vent zeal to lay hold of every thing that was new to him, and
that vivid and wonderfully retentive memory, which, to the
astonishment of all, he soon evinced.
As soon as Caspar had acquired, a sufficient knowledge of
language to enable him, though but imperfectly, to communicate
his ideas, means were employed to draw from him all he knew
concerning his wonderful and mysterious fate. The following
is the substances of his own account of himself, as given to the
publick in July, 1828, it being all he could recollect of the his-
tory of his past life.
- He knows not who he is, where he was born, nor where
he has lived. It was only on his appearance in Nuremberg
that he first came into the light of the world. Here he first
learned, that, besides himself and the man with whom he had
always been,' there existed other men and other creatures. As
far back as he can recollect, he had lived in a hole, or narrow
dungeon, where he had always sat upon the ground, with his
feet bare, and very thinly clad. He had never, even in his
sleep, lain down; but had always slept in an erect posture,
with his back supported by the wall of his narrow cell. In his
apartment, he had never heard a sound, whether produced by
man, an animal, or the elements. He had never seen the
heavens, nor the light of day; consequently, the distinction
between night and day, was utterly unknown to him. When-
ever he awoke from sleep, he had always found a loaf of bread
а.
and a pitcher of water by his side. Sometimes the water had
a bad taste ; (that is, opium was dissolved in it, as Caspar after.
ward ascertained by being made acquainted with this drug ;)
and whenever this was the case, he soon fell into a sound sleep,
and on awaking again, found that he had clean clothes on, and

brought him his food and drink.”

self, it being his only occupation, to make them run by his side,
and to tie the ribands about them in different positions. He had
never been* sick; and, in only one instance, had he felt the
sensation of pain. Upon the whole, he had been“ much happier
there than in the world, where the effect of external objects
upon his untutored senses, caused him much suffering. How
long he had lived in this situation, he knew not; for he had no
knowledge of time : nor did he know when or how he came
there; nor had he any recollection of ever having been* else-
where. His keeper had never done him any harm but once ;
and then he gave him a severe blow with a piece of wood, be.
cause he had run his horses so hard as to make a noise."
“At length the man came, lifted him up, placed him on his
feet, and endeavoured to teach him to stand. This ceremony
he repeated several times; until, at last, he came and placed
Caspar's hands over his shoulders, tied them fast, and then
carried him on his back out of the prison. When he approached
the fresh air, all became night;" that is, he fainted away.
Of Caspar's journey to the place where he was discovered by
the citizen of Nuremberg, all he recollects, is, that, whilst per-
forming it," several times he ate bread and drank water; that
the man with whom he had always been,' repeatedly tried to
teach him to walk, which attempts gave him great pain ; and
that the man never spoke to him, except to repeat the words,
• Reuta waehn,'
Caspar relates, that he never saw the face of the man, either
on this journey, or in his prison ; and that not long before he
was discovered in Nuremberg, the man had put the clothes upon
him which he then wore. He neither observed nor saw the
objects around him; and therefore could not tell from what
part of the country, in what direction, or by which way, he
All he was conscious of, was, that the man who had
been leading him, put the letter which he brought with him,
into his hand, and then disappeared.
This history of the mysterious imprisonment and exposure
of this ill-fated youth, presents, not only a fearful, but a most
singular and obscure, enigma ;-an enigma which may, indeed,
give rise to innumerable questions and conjectures, but upon
which no light has, as yet, been shed that is likely to lead to its

solution. Caspar's mental condition during his dungeon life,
must have been that of a human being, shut up in his infancy,
with his senses and his intellect immersed in a profound sleep,
in which pitiable condition he was compelled to drag out, at
least, sixteen long years of the bloom and spring-tide of life,
without being conscious of even a dream. From the stupor
of this more than half non-existent state, he at length awoke to
be stunned, and pained, and petrified, and amazed with the din,
and clamour, and unintelligible impressions of a variegated
world. This appearance of one of our fellow beings, who had
attained the physical powers and proportions of manhood, with.
out ever having learned the use of one of his senses, or without
ever having one ray of knowledge enter his benighted and in.
fantile soul, presents one of the most unique, and wonderful,
and interesting, and instruc:ive anomalies which the world has
ever beheld, and may be justly regarded as a new page in the
history of the human species.
What other crimes besides those of illegal imprisonment,
privation, and exposure, may lie concealed behind the iniquity
committed against Caspar, as well as the ends which his secret
incarceration was intended to subserve, we must leave with the
future to reveal.
SECTION X.
Caspar HauserContinued.
Of Caspar's extraordinary powers of memory, and his no
less wonderful ability to direct his attention to one object at a
time, singly and undividedly, (an ability to gain which, all the
efforts of the greatest philosophersd have hitherto proved un-
availing,) the following is an instance given by the Hon. Von
Feuerbach:
On entering Caspar's apartment in the Luginsland, at the
Vestner gate, accompanied by Col. Von D. and two ladies, he
showed nothing like shyness or timidity, but met us with confi-
dence, and seemed to be rejoiced at our visit. The first thing
that attracted his attention, was the Colonel's bright uniform ;
and particularly his helmet, which glittered with gold, he could
not cease to admire. After that, his attention was drawn to the
coloured dresses of the ladies; but as for myself, being dressed

in a plain, black frock coat, I was, for some time, scarcely
honoured with a single glance. Each of us, in turn, placed
himself separately before him, and mentioned his name and
title.
Whenever any one was thus introduced, Caspar went up
very close to him, regarded him with a sharp and somewhat
staring look, noticed, successively and singly, every part of his
face, as his forehead, his eyes, nose, mouth, chin, and so forth,
with a penetrating, rapid glance; and, as I could distinctly per-
ceive, at last, combined all the different portions of the counte-
nance, which he had collected, piece by piece, into one whole.
He then repeated the name of the person as it had been pro-
nounced to him; and now he knew him; and, as after-experience
proved, he knew him forever.
In noticing any one of the numerous things, whether small
or great, which were in his possession, he was able to mention
both the name and the title of the person who had bestowed it.
About an hour after we had left him, we met him on the street;
and, on demanding whether he could recollect our names, with.
out the least hesitation, he repeated the full name of every one
of the company, together with his title, which, nevertheless,
must have appeared to him as an unintelligible jargon. On
many occasions, still more striking examples of his quick and
wonderfully tenacious memory were displayed. Caspar averted
his eyes as much as possible from the light, their sensibility
being such as not to bear it; for, it must be borne in mind, that
in his dungeon, à ray of light had never visited them.
In regard to colours, he evinced a strange predilection for
glaring red, -blue, green, and paler hues, being held by him at
a comparatively low estimate. If the choice had been given
him, he would have clothed himself, and all for whom he had a
regard, in scarlet or purple. When a tree full of red apples
was shown him, he expressed much satisfaction at the sight, but
thought it would have been far more beautiful, had its leaves
also been as red as its fruit. There was but one advantage
more which, in his eye, his favourite animals, horses, might
have possessed. It was that, instead of being black, bay, or
white, their colour should invariably have been scarlet.
The curiosity and thirst for knowledge which he evinced,
together with the inflexible perseverance with which he fixed
his attention to any thing he was determined to learn or com-
prehend, surpassed every thing that can be conceived of them;
and the manner in which they were expressed, was truly affect-
ing. Having no longer any relish for his playthings, his hours.

throughout the day, were employed in writing, drawing, and
other instructive exercises with which professor Daumer engaged
him. Bitterly did he complain to us, that the great number of
visiters who thronged his apartment,* left him no time to learn
any thing. It was very affecting to hear his oſten-repeated
lamentation, that the people in the world knew so much, and
that there were so very many things which he had not yet
learned..
On account of the unpleasant and painſul sensations which
were produced by the many new impressions upon his faculties,
to which he was totally unaccustomed-impressions which
caused him excessive suffering, he appeared to be by no means
satisfied with living in the world, but longed to go back again to
“ the man with whom he had always been,” and regain the rest
and quietude he had enjoyed “at home in his hole.
Notwithstanding Caspar yielded, to those who had acquired
parental authority over him, unreserved and unconditional obe-
dience, yet, before he would acknowledge any thing to be certain
or true, it was necessary that he should be thoroughly con-
vinced, either by the testimony of his senses, by intuition, or by
some process of reasoning completely adapted to his powers of
comprehension and the scanty acquirements of his almost
vacant mind-an instructive lesson to such as areapt to take
things for granted without a proper examination of the evidence
upon which their truth or falsity rests. Whenever it was
impossible to reach his understanding through any of these
channels, he would not, indeed, contradict the assertion made,
but leave the matter undecided, until, as he would remark, he
had learned more.
When the first snow fell in the succeeding winter, on looking
out in the morning, he expressed great joy that the streets, the
roofs, and the trees, had been so well painted, and went quickly
down into the yard to fetch some of the white paint; but he
soon ran back to his preceptor, with all his fingers stretched out,
crying, blubbering, and bawling out, “ that the white paint had
bitten his hand.”
On my requesting Caspar to look out at the window upon an
extensive prospect of a beautiful landscape,' which presented
itself in all the glory of summer, he obeyed, but instantly drew
back with horrour, exclaiming "ugly! ugly!" This singular
and disagreeable effect produced upon his vision, he explained
to me in 1831, by remarking, that the landscape' upon which

he looked, then appeared to him like a window-shutter, placed
close to his eyes, upon which a wall painter had spattered the
contents of his different brushes, filled with white, blue, yellow,
and red paint, all mingled together; for at that time he had not
learned, by experience, to distinguish single objects from each
other, nor their various distances and magnitudes; but the dis-
agreeable, pary-coloured shutter appeared to come close up
before him in such a manner as to prevent his looking out into
the
open
air. He also remarked, that, for some time, he could
not distinguish by the eye alone, those objects which were really
round, square, or triangular, from the representation of such
objects in a painting. Men, horses, and other animals repre-
sented in pictures, appeared to him, as it regarded their round.
ness or flatness, precisely like the same, carved in wood. Their
real difference, however, by the assistance of the sense of feel.
ing, he soon learned, whilst engaged in packing and unpacking
his toys and trinkets. In short, all the phenomena of sight dis-
played by the young man who was couched by Dr. Cheselden,
and, indeed, many more, or, in other words, all the wonderful
phenomena which could be revealed by an infant, supposing it
could be enabled to explain them, whilst learning to apply the
organ of vision, were illustrated in Caspar.
On the 18th of July, Caspar was released from his abode in
the tower, and took up his residence in the family of professor
Daumer. With this worthy gentleman, he soon learned to
sleep in a bed, and, by degrees, to partake of common food.
The former caused him, for the first time, to have dreams,
which, until otherwise instructed, he looked upon as real trans-
actions.
The following observations concerning this wonderful youth,
are taken from the notes of Mr. Daumer. After he had learned
to eat meat, his mental vigour was abated; his eyes lost their
brilliancy; his unconquerable propensity to constant activity,
was diminished; the intense application of his mind gave way
to absence and indifference; and the quickness of his apprehen-
sion was also lessened. His change of diet, had, likewise, so
great an effect upon his growth, that, in a few weeks, he
increased more than two inches in height.
By being occasionally employed in easy garden-work, Caspar
became daily more and more acquainted with the productions,
phenomena, and powers of nature, which, whilst it tended greatly
to increase his stock of knowledge, constantly excited in him

feelings of wonder and admiration ; but it required no little
pains to correct his mistakes, and teach him the difference
between things organick and such as are not organized, between
things animate and inanimate, and between voluntary motion
and that which is communicated from external causes. Many
things which bore the form of men or animals, though cut in
stone, carved in wood, or painted, he would still conceive to be
animated, and ascribe to them such qualities as he perceived to
exist in animated beings. It appeared strange to him that the
figures of horses, unicorns, ostriches, and so forth, which were
either carved or painted upon the walls of houses, remained
always stationary. He wondered that they did not run away.
He expressed his indignation against a statue in the garden,
because, when very dirty, it did not wash itself. When, for the
first time, he saw the great crucifix on the outside of the church
of St. Sebaldus, the view affected him with deep sympathy and
horrour. He earnestly entreated that the man who was so
dreadfully tormented, might be taken down; nor could he, for a
long time, be pacified, although it was explained to him, that it
was not a real man, but merely an image, which felt nothing.
Every motion he observed to take place in any object, he
conceived to be voluntary, or a spontaneous effect of life. When
a sheet of paper was blown down from the table by the wind,
he thought that it had run away. On seeing a child's wagon
rolling down a hill, it was, in his opinion, making an excursion
to amuse itself. He supposed that a tree manifested its life by
the waving of its branches, and the motion of its leaves; and
its voice was heard' in the rustling of its leaves when they were
moved by the wind. He severely rebuked a boy for striking a
tree with a stick, and causing it, as he said, unnecessary pain.
The balls of a ninepin alley, he conceived, ran voluntarily
along, and, moreover, hurt other balls when they struck against
them ; and when they stopped, it was because they were tired.
He was, at length, convinced that a humming-top, which he had
long been spinning, did not move voluntarily, only by finding
that, after frequently winding up the cord, his arm began to
pain him-being thus sensibly convinced, that he had himself
communicated the power which caused it to move.
But to animals, particularly, for a long time he ascribed the
same properties as to men, and appeared to distinguish the one
from the other only by the difference in their external form. He
was angry with a cat for taking its food with its mouth, without

ever employing its hands for that purpose. He wished to teach
it to use its paws in eating, and to sit upright. He spoke to it
as to a rational being, and expressed great indignation at its
unwillingness to attend to what he said, and to learn from him;
but he once highly commended the obedience of a particular
dog. On seeing some oxen lying down in the street, he won.
dered why they did not go home, and lie down there. When
it was told him, that such things could not be expected from
animals, which knew no better, he replied, “ Then they ought
to learn : there are many things which I, also, am obliged to
learn.'
He had not the least conception of the origin and growth of
any of the productions of nature, but imagined that trees,
plants, leaves, and flowers, and the like, were the mere work-
manship of human hands. This mistake was corrected by his
preceptor's causing him to plant some beans, and afterward to
notice how they germinated, and produced leaves and fruit.
Of the beauties of nature, for a long time, he had no idea ;
nor did they seem otherwise to interest him than merely to ex-
cite his curiosity to know who made such and such things. Yet
there was one view presented to him, which formed a remark-
able exception to the truth of this observation, and which ought
to be regarded as an important and never-to-be-forgotten inci.
dent in the gradual development of his intellectual faculties. It
was on a fine summer evening in the month of August, 1829,
that his instructer showed him, for the first time, the starry
heavens. His astonishment and transport at the sight, tran-
scended all bounds, and surpassed description. He could not
be satisfied with looking and gazing at the sublime spectacle :
at the same time, he fixed accurately, with his eye, the different
groups of stars that were pointed out to him, noticed those most
distinguished for their brightness, and remarked the difference
in their respective colours. “This," he exclaimed, “is, indeed,
the most beautiful and magnificent sight I have ever beheld in
the world. But who placed all those beautiful candles there?
who lights them ? who puts them out ?" were the interrogatories
which burst from his enraptured soul. When he was informed,
that, like the sun, with which he had been for some time ac-
quainted, they always remain there to give light by night, he
was still not satisfied, but eagerly demanded again, who had
made and hung them up on high, that they might thus illumine
that spacious vault ;—for, as yet, he had not formed a just idea
of that Being who made all things, who "rules the heavenly

host,” and “ calls the stars by name.” At length, after standing
motionless for some time, he fell into a train of profound medi-
tation. On recovering from this revery; his transport was
succeeded by deep sadness. He sunk pale and trembling upon
a chair, and asked, “why that wicked man had kept him
always locked up-him who had never done any harm-and
had never shown him any of these beautiful things.'
Caspar was soon after put under the care of a riding-master;
in which situation, in the delightful and noble accomplishment
of horsemanship, he soon greatly excelled. But besides his
extraordinary equestrian talents, the striking peculiarity, the
almost preternatural acuteness and intensity of his perceptions,
as evinced in the power of his senses, appeared so remarkable
and wonderful in him as to elicit the admiration and astonish.
ment of all.
As to his sight, there existed, in respect to him, no twilight,
no night, no darkness. He revelled in an ocean of light. One
unclouded day shone perpetually on his visual orb. He often
looked with astonishment" upon others who were compelled to
grope
their
way in the dark, or to use a candle or lantern. In
twilight, however, he could see far better than in broad day.
light. Thus, aſter sunset, he once read the number of a house
at a distance of 180 paces, which, in daylight, he was not able
to distinguish so far off. Towards the close of twilight, he once
pointed out to his instructer, a gnat that was hanging in a spi-
der's web
very
distant. At a distance of 60 paces, he could
distinguish, in the dark, elder-berries from black currants. In
a totally dark night, he could also distinguish from each other,
the different, dark colours, such as blue and green. When, at
the commencement of twilight, a common eye could not per.
ceive more than three or four stars in the sky, he could discernd
the different groups, and distinguish, from each other, the sev.
eral single stars of which the groups were composed, according
to their magnitudes and the peculiarities of their coloured light.
In distinguishing objects near by, his sight was as sharp as it
was penetrating in discerning them at a distance. In anatom.
izing plants, he often noticed subtile distinctions and delicate
particles which had entirely escaped the observation of others.
But no less wonderful was the acuteness of his hearing.
When taking a walk in the fields, he once heard, at a distance
comparatively very great, the footsteps of several persons, and
was able to distinguish them from each other by their tread.

:
Of all his senses, however, that which proved the most ex-
traordinary, and which gave him so many disagreeable and
painful sensations as frequently to make him miserable, was the
sense of smelling. What to ordinary olfactories, is entirely
scentless, was by no means so to his. The most delicate and
delightful odours of flowers, such, for instance, as those im-
parted by the rose, were perceived by him as insupportable
stenches, which painfully affected his nerves. What announces
itself to others by its smell only when near, was scented by him
at a great distance. Excepting the smell of bread, of fennel,
of anise, and of caraway, to which he had been already accus-
tomed in his prison, (for there, it appears, his bread was sea-
soned with these condiments,) all kinds of smells were more or
less disagreeable to him : so much so, that, when asked, which
of all smells he liked best, he piquantly replied, “none at all.”
His walks and rides were often rendered very unpleasant by
their conducting him near flower gardens, tobacco fields, nut
trees, and other ordinary shrubs and plants, which affected his
olfactory nerves, and caused him to pay dearly for his recrea-
tions in the open air, by their inflicting upon him head-aches,
cold-sweats, and attacks of fever. Tobacco in blossom he could
smell at the distance of fifty paces; and that hung up to dry,
one hundred paces off. He could distinguish apple, pear, and
plum trees from each other, at a considerable distance, hy the
smell of their leaves. The different colouring materials used
in painting and dying, and even the ink and pencil with which
he wrote in short, all things around him waſted odours to his
nostrils which were either unpleasant or painful to him. The
smell of old cheese sickened him. The smell of vinegar, though
it stood some distance from him, would bring tears into his eyes.
The smell of champaign and other wines, would produce a
heat in his head, and make him ill; but of all smells, the most
horrible to him, was that of fresh meat.
In the autumn of 1828, when Caspar was walking with pro-
fessor Daumer near St. John's churchyard, the smell of the dead
bodies in their graves, of which the professor had not the
slightest perception, affected him so powerfully that he was
immediately seized with an ague. This was soon succeeded
by an intense, feverish heat, which at length broke out into a
most profuse perspiration. After the profuse sweats had sub-
sided, he felt better, but complained that his sight had been
obscured by this severe attack. Similar effects were once
experienced by him after walking for some time near a tobacco
field.

Caspar's sense of feeling, and susceptibility of metallick and
magnetick excitement, were also very extraordinary. When
professor Daumer, by way of experiment, held the north pole
of a magnet towards him," he put his hand to the pit of his
stomach, and, drawing his waistcoat in an outward direction,
remarked that the magnet drew him thus, and that a current of
air seemed to proceed from him. The south pole affected him
less powerfully; and he said that it appeared like a current of
air blowing upon him.
In regard to his sensibility to the presence of metals, and his
power to distinguish them from each other merely by his feel-
ings, one or two instances may suffice. On entering a store
filled with hardware, he immediately hurried out again, being
affected with violent shuddering, and complaining that he felt a
drawing sensation in every part of his body, and in all direc-
tions at once.
Upon a person's slipping a gold coin into Cas-
par's hand without his seeing it, he immediately remarked, that
he felt gold in his hand. At a time when Caspar was absent,
professor Daumer once placed a gold ring, a brass and steel
compass, and a silver drawing pen under some paper, and in
such a manner that it was impossible for him to see what was
concealed under it. Mr. Daumer then directed him to move his
finger over the paper without touching it. He did so; and by
the difference of the sensation and the power of attraction which
the various metals caused him to feel at the points of his fingers,
he accurately distinguished and described them all, each from
the other, according to its respective matter and form.
With view to deceive him, Caspar was once required, in
the presence of several distinguished gentlemen, to run his hand
over the paper, when, as they supposed, nothing was concealed
under it. After moving his finger over it, he exclaimed, “ there
it draws.” “But this time," replied professor Daumer, as he
withdrew the paper, “ you are mistaken, for nothing lies under
it.” Caspar seemed, at first, to be somewhat embarrassed; but
putting his finger again to the place where he thought he had
felt the drawing, he assured them more positively than before,
that he there felt a drawing. The oil cloth was then removed;
and upon making a stricter search, i needle was actually found
under it.
But notwithstanding the interest and instruction to be derived
from an examination of Caspar's physical and physiological
aspect, the contemplation of his intellectual powers and of their
development and operation, after having lain so long dormant,

opens up a field still more richly stored with novelty and just
subjects of philosophical investigation : and whilst we here dis,
cover the acuteness of his natural understanding, we are, at the
same time, enabled to draw exact conclusions concerning the
fate of his life, and the state of utter neglect in which his mind
had so long been left by the profligacy and baseness of human
beings. Though his heart was filled with a child-like gentleness
and kindness, which rendered him incapable of hurting a worm
or a fly, much less, a man--though, in all the various relations
of life, his conduct evinced that his soul was as pure and spot-
less as the reflex of the eternal in the soul of an angel, yet, as
has already been observed, he brought with him from his dun-
geon to the light of the world, not an idea, not the least presen.
timent of the existence of a God, not the shadow of a belief
in a more elevated, invisible intelligence than himself. Raised
like an animal, slumbering even while awake, in the desert of
his narrow dungeon, sensible only of the crudest wants of ani.
mal nature, occupied with nothing but the taking of his food
and the eternal sameness of his wooden horses, his life may be
compared to that of an oyster, which, adhering to its rock, is
sensible of nothing but the absorption of its food, and perceives
nothing but the everlasting, uniform dashing of the waves, find-
ing in its narrow shell no room for the most limited idea of a
world without. But Caspar was soon enabled to form a just
conception of spiritual existences, and of a God; and he has
now become as sincerely pious as he is innocent and amiable.
In October, 1828, an attempt was made, at mid-day, to mur.

writers'. The colonist'. . has often treated them like beasts of

lingering three days, expired of his wounds. The villain fied; and, at the date of
the latest accounts, he had not been apprehended. Suspicion liad fallen upon a

of the forest were persecuted and defamed', not because they
were'a. . guilty', but because they were... . ignorant'.
The rights of the savage have seldom been properly appre-
ciated or respected by the white man'. In peace', he has too
often been the dupe of artſul traffick'; in wur', he has been re-
garded as a ferocious animal', whose life or death was a question
of mere precaution and convenience'. Man is cruelly wasteful
of life when his own safety is endangered', and he is sheltered
by impunity'; and little mercy is to be expected from him when
he feels the sting of the reptile', and is conscious of the power
to destroy'.
The same prejudices which were indulged thus early', exist',
in common circulation', at the present day'. Certain learned
societies', it is true', have endeavourde', with laudable diligence',
to investigate and record the real characters and manners of the
Indian tribes'. The American government', too', has wisely and
humanely exerted itself to inculcate a friendly and forbearing spirit
towards them', and to protect them from fraud andú injustice'.
The current opinion of the Indian character', however', is too
apt to be formed from the miserable hordes which infest the
frontiers', and hang on the skirts of the settlements'.e These'..
are too commonly composed of degenerate brings', corrupted
and enfeehled by the vices of society', without being benefited
by its civilization'. That proud independence which formed
the main pillar of savage virtue', has been shaken down', and
the whole moral fabrick lies in ruins'. Their spirits'. . are hu-
miliated and debased by a sense of inferiority', and their native
courage'. . cowed and daunted' by the superiour knowledge and
power of their enlightened neighbours'. Society has advanced
upon them like one of those withering airs that will sometimes
breathe desolation over a whole region of fertility'. It has ener-
vated their strength', multiplied their diseases', and superindu-
ced
upon their original barbarity the low vices of artificial life.

diminished their means of mere existence'.h It has driven be.

How different was their state', while yet the undisputed lords
of the soil'! Their wants were few', and the means of grati-
fication within their reach'. They saw every one round them
sharing the same lot', enduring the same hardships', feeding on
the same aliments', arrayed in the same rude garments'. No
roof then rose'. . but it was open to the homeless stranger'; no
smoke curled among the trees'. . but he was welcome to sit down
by its fire', and join the hunter in his repast'. For',”
old historian of New-England', “ their life is so void of care',
and they are so loving also', that they make use of those things
they enjoy as common goods', and are therein so compassionate',
that rather than one should starve through want', they would
starve all': thus do they pass their time merrily', not regarding
our pomp', but are better content with their own', which some
men esteem so meanly of'.” Such were the Indians', whilst
in the pride and energy of their primitive natures'. They re.
semble those wild plants which thrive best in the shades of the
forest', but shrink from the hand of cultivation', and perish
beneath the influence of the sun'.
In discussing the savage character', writers have been too
prone to indulge in vulgar prejudice and passionate exaggera.
tion', instead of the candid temper of true philosophy'. They
have not sufficiently considered the peculiar circumstances in
which the Indians have been placed', and the peculiar principles
under which they have been educated'. No being acts more
rigidly from rule than the Indian'. His whole conduct is regu.
lated according to some general maxims early implanted in his
mind'. The moral laws that govern him', are', to be sure', but
few'; but then', he conforms to them all'; ——the white man
abounds in laws of religion', morals', and manners'; but how
many does he violate'!

A frequent ground of accusation against the Indians', is their
disregard of treaties', and the treachery and wantonness with
which', in time of apparent peace', they will suddenly fly to
hostilities'. The intercourse of the white men with the Indians',
however', is too apt to be cold', distrustful', oppressive', and insult-
ing'. They seldom treat them with that confidence and frank.
ness which are indispensable to real friendship'; nor is sufficient
caution observed not to offend against those feelings of pride or
superstition', which often prompt the Indian to hostility quicker
than mere considerations of interest'. The solitary savage'.
feels silently', but'. . acutely'. His sensibilities are not diffused
over so wide a surface as those of the white man'; but they run
in steadier and deeper channels'. His pride', his affections', his
superstitions', are all directed towards fewer objects'; but the
wounds inflicted on them', are proportionably severe', and fur.
nish motives of hostility which we cannot sufficiently appre.
ciate'. Where a community is also limited in number, and
forms one great patriarchal family', as in an Indian tribe', the
injurye of an individual', is the injurye of the whole'; and the
sentiment of vengeance is almost instantaneously diffused'. One
council-fire is sufficient for the discussion and arrangement of a
plan of hostilities'. Here', all the fighting men and sages assem-

minds of the warriours'. The orator' awakens their martial

We stigmatize the Indians', also', as cowardly and treach.
erous', because they use stratagem in warfare', in preference to
open force'; but', if courage intrinsically consists in the defiance
of danger and pain', the life of the Indian is a continual ex.
hibition of it. He lives in a state of perpetual hostility and
risk'. Peril and adventured are congenial to his nature';e or',
rather', seem necessary to arouse his faculties', and to give an
interest to his existence'. Surrounded by hostile tribes', whose
mode of warfare is by ambush and surprisal', he is always
prepared for fight', and lives with his weapons in his hands'.

As the ship'.. careers in fearſul singleness through the solitudes
of ocean', -as the bird'.. mingles among clouds and storms',
and wings its way', a mere speckſ, across the pathless fields of
air', so the Indian holds his course', silent', solitary', but un.
daunted'," through the boundless bosom of the wilderness'. His
expeditions may vie in distance and danger with the pilgrimage.
of the devotee', or the crusade of the knight-errant'. He tra-
verses vast forests', exposed to the hazards of lonely sickness',
of lurking enemies', and pining ſamine'. Stormy lakes', those
great inland seas', are no obstacles to his wanderings': in his
light canoe of bark', he sports', like a feather', on their waves',
and darts', with the swiſtness of an arrow', down the roaring
rapids of the rivers'. His very subsistence' .. is snatched from
the midst of toil and peril'. He gains his food by the hardships
and dangers of the chase'; he wraps himself in the spoils of the
bear', the panther', and the buffalo'; and sleeps among the
thunders of the cataract'.
No hero of ancient or modern days can surpass the Indian
in his loſty contempt of death', and the fortitude with which he
sustains its cruelesi affiction'. Indeed', we here behold him
rising superiour to the white man', in consequence of his pecu-
liar education'. The latter'.. rushes to glorious death'.. at the
cannon's mouth'; the former'.. calmly contemplates its ap-
proach', and triumphantly endures it', amidst the varied torments
of surrounding foes', and the protracted agonies of fire'. He
even takes a pride in taunting his persecutors', and provoking
their ingenuity of torture';' and', as the devouring flames prey
on his very vitals', and the flesh shrinks from the sinews', he
raises his last song of triumph', breathing the defiance of an
unconquered heart', and invoking the spirits of his fathers to
witness'... that he dies without a groan'.
Notwithstanding the obloquy with which the early historians
have overshadowed the characters of the unfortunate natives',
some bright gleams occasionally break through', which throw
a degree of melancholy lustre on their memories'. Facts are
occasionally to be met with in the rude annals of the eastern
provinces', which', though recorded with the colouring of preju.
dice and bigotry', yet speak for themselves'; and will be dwelt
on with applause and sympathy', when prejudice shall have
passed away':
In one of the homely narratives of the Indian wars in New-
England', there is a touching account of the desolation carried

the cold blooded detail of indiscriminate butchery'. In one place
we read of the surprisal of an Indian fort in the night', when
the wigwams were wrapped in flames', and the miserable inhab.

despatched and ended in the course of an hour'." After a series
of similar transactions', “our soldiers'," as the historian piously
observes', “ being-resolved', by God's assistance', to make a

sword',' a scanty but gallant band', the sad remnant of the
Pequod warriours', with their wives and children', took refuge

Burning with indignation', and rendered sullen by despair';4
with hearts bursting with grief at the destruction of their tribe',
and spirits galled and sore at the fancied ignominy of their
defeat, they refused to ask their lives at the hands of an insult-
ing foe', and preferred death to submission'.
As the night drew on', they were surrounded in their dismal
retreat', so as to render escape' impracticable'. Thus situated',
“plied them with shot all the time', by which
means many were killed and buried in the mire'.” In the dark.
ness and fog that preceded the dawn of day', some few broke
through the besiegers and escaped into the woods': “the rest
were left to the conquerors', of which many were killed in the
swamp', like sullen dogs', who would rather', in their self-willed-
ness and madness', sit still and be shot through', or cut to pieces',"'
than implore for mercy': When the day broke upon this handfull
of forlorn but dauntless spirits', the soldiers', we are told', enter.

twelve pistol-bullets at a time'; putting the muzzles of the pieces
under the boughs', within a few yards of them'; so as', besides
those that were found dead', many more were killed and sunk
into the mire', and never were minded more by friend or foel.”
Can any one read this plain', unvarnished tale', without ad.

of spirit', that seemed to nerve the hearts of these self-taught
heroes', and to raise them above the instinctive feelings of human
nature'? When the Gauls laid waste the city of Rome', they
found the senators clothed in their robes', and seated with stern

SECTION XIII.
Speech of Logan, Chief of the Mingoes.—JEFFERSON.
I may challenge the whole of the orations of Demosthenes
and Cicero, and, indeed, of any more eminent orators, if Europe,
or the world, has furnished more eminent, to produce a single
passage superiour to the speech of Logan, a Mingo chief, deliv.
ered to Lord Dunmore, when governour of Virginia. As a
testimony of Indian talents in this line, I beg leave to introduce
it, by first stating the incidents" necessary for understanding it.
In the spring of the year 1774, a robbery was committed
by some Indians upon certain land adventurers on the Ohio
river. The whites in that quarter, according to their custom,
undertook to punish this outrage in a summary way. Captain
Michael Cresap and one Daniel Greathouse, leading on these
parties, surprised, at different times, travelling and hunting par-
ties of the Indians, who had their women and children with
them, and murdered many. Among these were unfortunately
the family of Logan, a chief celebrated in peace and war, and
long distinguished as the friend of the whites. This unworthy
return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly signalized
himself in the war which ensued. In the autumn of the same
year a decisive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great
Kenhaway, between the collected forces of the Shawnese, the
Mingoes, and the Delawares, and a detachment of the Virginia
militia. The Indians were defeated, and sued for peace. Lo.
gan, however, disdained to be seen among the suppliants: but,
lest the sincerity of a treaty, from which so distinguished a
chief absented himself, should be distrusted, he sent, by a mes.
senger, the following speech to be delivered to Lord Dunmore.
“I appeal to any white man to say', if ever he entered Lo-
gan's cabin hungry', and he gave him not meat'; if ever he came
cold and naked', and he clothed him not'. During the course
of the last long and bloody war', Logan remained idle in his
cabin', an advocate for peace'. Such was my love for the
whites', that my countrymen pointed as they passed', and said',
• Logan is the friend of the white men'.' I had even thought

The needle points faithfully o'er the dim sea,
So, dark as I roam, in this wintry world shrouded,
The hope of my spirit turns trembling to Thee,

Hail! holy Light, offspring of Heaven first born,
Or of the eternal co-eternal beam,
May I express thee unblamed? Since God is light,
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright essencec increate,
Or hear'st thou, rather, pure ethereal stream,
Whose fountain who shall tell ? Before the sun,
Before the heavens, thou wert, and at the voice
Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest
The rising world of waters dark and deep,
Won from the void and formless infinite.
Thee I revisit now with bolder wing,
Escaped the Stygian pool, though long detained
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight,
Through utter and through middle darkness borne,
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
I sung of chaos and eternal night.
Taught by the heavenly muse to venture down
The dark descent, and up to reascend,
Though hard and rare; Thee I revisit safe,
And feel thy sovereign, vital lamp; but thou
Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain,

DARKNESS.
257
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs,
Or dim suffusion veiled. Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the muses haunt,
Clear spring or shady grove, or sunny hill,
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,
That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget
Those other two, equalled with me in fate,
So were I equalled with them in renown,
Blind Thamyris and blind Mæonides,
And Tyresias and Phineas, prophets old :
Then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid,
Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year,
Seasons return, but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of even and morn;
Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine ;
But cloud, instead, and ever-during dark
Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of rnen
Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair,
Presented with a universal blank
Of nature's works, to me expunged and razed,
And wisdom, at one entrance, quite shut out.
So much the rather thou, celestial Light,
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate: there plant eyes, all mist from thence
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight.

I had a dream', which was not all a dream'.
The bright sun was extinguished', and the stars
Did wander', darkling in the eternal space',
Rayless' and pathless', and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air.
Morn came', and went', and came', and brought no day',
And men forgot their passions in the dread
Of this their desolation'; and all hearts
Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light'.
And they did live by watchfires'; and the thrones
The palaces of crowned kings'—the huts',
The habitations of all things
which dwell',
Were burned for beacons! Cities were consumed',
And men were gathered round their blazing homes
To look once more into each other's face':

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn',
Or busy housewifea ply her evening care;
Nor children run to lisp their sire's return',
Or climb his knees', the envied kiss to share'.
Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield';
Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke';
How jocund, did they drive their team a-field'!
How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!!
Let not ambition mock their useful toil',
Their homely joys and destiny obscure';
Nor grandeur hear', with a disdainful smile',
The short and simple annals of the poor!
The boast of heraldry', the pomp
of power',
And all that beauty', all that wealth'..e'erd gave',
Await', alike', the inevitable hour';
The paths of glory lead'... but to the grave'.
Nor you', ye proud', impute to these the fault',
If mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophiese raise',
Where', through the long-drawn aislef and fretted vault';
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise
Can storied urn', or animated busť,
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath'?
Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
Or flattery sooth the dull', cold ear of death'?
Perhaps'.. in this neglected spot'.. is laid'
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire';
Hands' .. that the rod of empire might have swayed',
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:
But knowledge to their eyes her ample page',
Rich with the spoils of time', did ne'ers unrol';
Chill penury repressed their noble rage',
And froze the genial current of the soul'.
Full many a gem'.. of purest ray serene',
The dark', unfathomed caves of ocean bear';
Full many a flower'.. is born to blush unseen',
And waste its sweetness' .. on the desert air'.
Some village Hampden', that', with dauntless breast,
The little tyrant of his fields withstood';—
Some mute', inglorious Milton', here may rest';
Some Cromwell', guiltless of his country's blood.
Th' applause of list'ning senates to command',
The threats of pain and ruin to despise',
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land',
And read their histry in a nation's eyes',

Their lot forbade';* nor circumscribed alone'
Their growing virtues', but their crimes confined.;
Forbadea to wade through slaughter to a throne',
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind':
The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide',
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame';
Or heap the shrine of luxury and pride',
With incense kindled at the muse's flame!
Far from the madd’ning crowd's ignoble strife',
Their sober wishes never learned to stray';-
Along the cool', sequestered vale of life',
They kept the noiseless tenour of their way'.
Yet even these bones', from insult to protect',
Some frail memorial still erected nigh',
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculptureb decked',
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.
Their name', their years', spelled by th’unlettered muse
The place of fume and elegy supply';
And many a holy text around she strews',c
That teach* the rustick moralist to die'.
For who', to dumb forgetfulnéss a prey'.
This pleasing', anxious being e'erd resigned';
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day',
Nor cast one longing', ling'ring look behind'?
On some fond breast the parting soul relies';
Some pious drops the closing eye requires';
Even from the tomb the voice of naturee cries',
Even in our ashes live their wonted fires!
For thee', who', mindful of the unhonoured dead',
Dostf in these lines their artless tale relate',
If chance', by lonely, contemplation led',
Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate';
Haply some hoary-headed swain may say',
« Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn',
Brushing with hasty step the dews away',
To meet the sun upon the upland lawn'
There at the foot of yonder nodding beech',
That wreathes its old fantastick roots so high',
His listless length at noontide would he stretch',
And pore upon the brook that babbles by'.

Hard by yon wood', now smiling', as in scorn',
Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove:
Now drooping, woful', wan', like one forlorn',
Or crazed with care', or crossed in hopeless love!
One morn I missed him on th'accustomed hill',
Along the heath', and near his fav'ritea tree';
Another came'; nor yet beside the rill',
Nor
up the lawn', nor at the wood'.. was he'.

Slow through the churchway path we saw him borne';

Here rests his head upon the lap of earth',
A youth to fortune', and to fame unknown';
Fair sciencec frowned not on his hunibled birth',
And melancholy marked him for her own'.
Large was his bounty', and his soul, sincere:
Heaven did a recompense as largely send'.
He gave to misery all he had'-a tềar',
He gained from heaven' ('twas all he wished') a friend.
No farther seek his merits to disclose',
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode';
(There they', alike', in trembling hope repose';)
The bosom of his Father and his God'.

Stanzas.—DR. PERCIVAL.
My heart was a mirror, that showed every treasuree
Of beauty and loveliness life can display;
It reflected each beautiful blossom of pleasure,
But turned from the dark looks of bigots away;
It was living and moving with loveliest of creatures,
In smiles or in tears as the soft spirits chose;
Now, shining with brightest and ruddiest features,
Now, pale as the snow of the dwarf mountain rose.
But the winds and the storms broke the mirror, and severed
Full many a beautiful angel in twain;
And the tempest raged on till the fragments were shivered,
And scattered, like dust that rolls over the plain :

One piece which the storm in its madness neglected,
Away on the wings of the whirlwind to bear,
One fragment was left, and that fragment reflected
All the beauty that Mary threw carelessly there.
OUR Eagle shall rise 'mid the whirlwinds of war,
And dart through the dun cloud of battle his eye ;-
Shall spread his wide wings o'er the tempest afar,
O’er spirits of valour that conquer or die.
And ne'era shall the rage of the conflict be o'er,
And ne'era shall the warm blood of life cease to flow,
And still 'mid the smoke of the battle shall soar
Our Eagle-till scattered and fled be the foe:
When peace shall disarm war's dark brow of its frown,
And roses shall bloom on the soldier's rude grave,
Then honour shall weave of the laurel a crown
That beauty shall bind on the brow of the brave.

Dedications.-LORD Bacon.
The dedication of books to patrons',a in this age', is not to
be commended'; for such books as are worthy of the name',
ought to have no patrons but truth and reason. The ancientu
custom was', to dedicate them only to private and equal
friends', or to entitle them with a friend's name'; or', if dedi-
cated to kings or great personages', it was to those only to
whose talents and taste the argument of the work was pecu-
liarly suited'.
I would not be understood', however, as condemning the
applications of the learned to men of fortune', when the occa-
sion renders it proper and expedient'. The answer of Dio-
genesol was just', who', when asked', tauntingly', “How it
came to pass that philosopherse were the followers of rich
men', and not rich men', of philosophers',»e replied', soberly',
and yet', sharply', " Because philosopherse know what they
“
need'; but rich men do not'."
Equally pointed was the following reply of Aristippus'. On
presenting a petition to Dionysius without being able to gain his
attention', he fell down at his feet'; whereupon Dionysius was
prevailed on to give him a hearing', and to grant his request'.
But afterward', some one over-sensitive for the reputation of
philosophy', reproved Aristippus for having offered so great an
indignity to his profession', as for a philosopher to fall at a
tyrant's feet':-to whom Aristippus replied, “It is not my
'
fault', sir', but the fault of Dionysius', that he has his ears in
his feet'." Nor was it accounted weakness', but discretion',
in him who excused himself for not disputing a point with
Adrianus Cesar', by saying', “It is the dictate of reason to
* yield the argument to one who commands thirty legions'.

Reflections on Westminster Abbey.-ADDISON.
WHEN I am in a serious humour', I very often walk by my.
self in Westminster Abbey'; where the gloominess of the place
and the use to which it is applied', together with the solemnity
of the building', and the condition of the people who lie in it',
are apt to fill the mind with a kind of melancholy', or', rather',
thoughtfulness', that is not disagreeable'. Yesterday I passed
a whole afternoon in the church-yard', the cloisters', and the
church', amusing myself with the tombstones and inscriptions
which I met with in those several regions of the dead'. Most
of them record nothing else of the buried person', but that he
was born on one day', and died on another'; two circumstances
that are common to all mankind'. I could not but look upon
those registers of existence'," whether of brass or marble', as a
kind of satire upon the departed persons', who had left no other
memorial of themselves', than', that they were born', and that
they died'.
Upon my going into the church', I entertained myself with
the digging of a grave', and saw', in every shovelful of it that
was thrown up', the fragment of a bone or scull', intermixed
with a kind of fresh', mouldering earth', which', some time or
other', had held a place in the composition of a human body'.
Upon this', I began to consider with myself', what innumerable
multitudes of people lay confused together under the pavement"
of that ancientº cathedral'; how men and women', friends' and
enemies', priests' and soldiers', monks' and prebendaries', were
crumbled among one another', and blended together in the same
common mass';—how beauty', strength', and youth', with old
age', weakness', and deformity', lay undistinguished in the same
promiscuous heap of matter!
After having thus surveyed this great magazine of mortality',
as it were',' in the lump', I examined it more particularly by
the accounts which I found on several of the monuments',

which are raised in every quarter of that ancienta fabrick'.
Some of them are covered with such extravagant epitaphs',
that', if it were possible for the dead person to be acquainted
with them', he would blush at the praise which his friends have
bestowed upon him. There are others so excessively modest,
that they deliver the character of the departed person in Greek
or Hebrew', and', by that means', are not understood once in a
twelvemonth'. In the poetical quarter', I found there wereh
poets who had no monuments, and monumentse that had no
poets'. I observed', indeed', that the present war had filled the
church with many of those uninhabited monuments', which had
been erected to the memory of persons whose bodies were',' per-
haps', buried in the plains of Blenheim', or in the bosom of the
ocean'.
I could not but be very much delighted with several modern
epitaphs', which are written with great elegance of expression
and justness of thought', and which', therefore', do honour to
the living as well as to the dead'. As a foreigner is very apt
to conceive an idea of the ignorance or politeness of a nation',
from the turn of its publick monuments and inscriptions', these
should be submitted to the perusal of men of learning and ge-
nius', before they are put into execution'. Sir Cloudsly Shovel's
monumentº has very often given me great displeasure'. Instead
of the brave', rough', English admiral', which was the distin-
guishing characteristick of that plain', gallant man', he is repre-
sented', on his tomb', by the figure of a beau', dressed in a long
periwig', and reposing himself upon velvet cushions', under a
canopy of state'.
The inscription is answerable to the monu.
ment';° for', instead of celebrating the many remarkable actions
which he had performed in the service of his country', it ac-
quaints us only with the manner of his death', in which it was
impossible for him to reap any honour'. The Dutch', whom
we are apt to despise for want of genius'; show an infinitely
better taste in their buildings and works of this nature',d than
we meet with in those of our own country'. The monuments
of their admirals', which have been erected at the publick ex.
pense', represent them like themselves, and are adorned with
rostral crowns and naval ornaments',e with beautiful festoons of
seaweed', shells', and coral'.
I know that entertainments of this natured are apt to raise
dark and dismal thoughts in timorous minds and gloomy imagi-
nations'; but', for my own part', though I am always serious',

I do not know what it is to be melancholy, and can', therefore', a
take a view of natureb in her deep and solemn scenes', with the
same pleasure as in her most gay and delightful ones'. By this
means', I can improve myself with objects which others consider
Ι
with terrour'. When I look upon the tombs of the great', every
emotion of envy dies within me'; when I read the epitaphs of
the beautiful', every inordinate desire goes out'; when I meet
with the grief of parentse upon a tombstone',, my heart melts
with compassion'; when I see the tomb of the parents them-
selves', I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we
must quickly follow'. When I see kings lying by those who
deposed them';—when I consider rival wits placed side by side',
or the holy men that divided the world with their contests and
disputes'; I reflect', with sorrow and astonishment', on the little
competitions', factions', and debates of mankind'. When I read
the several dates of the tombs', of some that died yesterday',
and some six hundred years ago', I consider that great day when
we shall all of us be cotemporaries', and make our appearance
together'.

Reflections on Westminster Abbey-Extract.-IRVING.
I sat', for some time', lost in that kind of
revery
which a
strain of musick is apt', at times', to inspire'. The shadows
of evening were gradually thickening around me'; the monu-
ments began to cast deeper and deeper gloom'; and the distant
clock againd gave token of the slowly waning day':
I rose', and prepared to leave the abbey'. As I descended
the flight of steps which lead into the body of the building', my
eye was caught by the shrine of Edward the Confessor'; and I
ascended the small staircase that conducts to it', to take from
thence a general survey of this wilderness of tombs'. The
shrine is elevated upon a kind of platform'; and close around
it are the sepulchres of various kings and queens'. From this
eminence', the eye looks down between pillars and funeral tro-
phiese to the chapels and chambers below', crowded with tombs',
where warriours', prelates', courtiers', and statesmen', lie
mouldering in their beds of darkness'.” Close by me stood
the great chair of coronation', rudely carved of oak', in the bar

barous taste of a remote and gothick age'. The scene seemed
almost as if contrived', with theatrical artifice', to produce an
effect upon the beholder'. Here was a type of the beginning
and the end of human pomp and power'; here it was literally
but a step from the throne to the sepulchre's Would not one
think', that these incongruous mementoes had been gathered to-
gether as a lesson to living greatness'?—to show it', even in
the moment of its proudest exaltation', the neglect and dishon-
our to which it must soon arrive'?-how soon that crown which
encircles its brow', must pass away'; and how soon it must lie
down in the dust and disgraces of the tomb', and be trampled
upon by the feet of the meanest of the multitude"? For', strange
to tell', even the
grave
is here no longer a sanctuary'. There
is a shocking levity in some natures', which leads them to sport
with awful and hallowed things'; and there are base minds',
which delight to revenge on the illustrious dead', the abject
homage and grovelling servility which they pay to the living':
The coffin of Edward the Confessor has been broken open', and
his remains despoiled of their funeral ornaments';e the sceptre
has been stolen from the hand of the imperious Elizabeth', and
the effigy of Henry the Fifth lies headless'. Not a royal mon-
ument but bears some proof how false and fugitive is the hom.
age of mankind'. Some are plundered'; some', mutilated';
some', covered with ribaldry and insult';~all', more or less',
outraged and dishonoured'!
The last beams of day were now faintly streaming through
the painted windows in the high vaults above me': the lower
parts of the abbey were already wrapped in the obscurity of
twilight': The chapels and aisles' grew darker and darker.
The effigies of the kings faded into shadows'; the marble fig-
ures of the monuments assumed strange shapes in the uncer-
tain light'; the evening breeze crept through the aisles like the
cold breath of the grave'; and even the distant foot-fall of a
verger', traversing the Poet's Corner', had something strange
and dreary in its sound'. I slowly retraced my morning's walk',
and', as I passed out at the portal of the cloisters', the door',
closing with a jarring noise behind me', filled the whole building
with echoes'.
I endeavoured to form some arrangement in my mind of the
objects I had been contemplating', but found they were already
falling into indistinctness and confusion'. Names', inscriptions',
trophies',had all become confounded in my recollection', though

I had scarcely taken my foot from off the threshold'. What',
thought I', is this vast assemblage of sepulchres but a treasury
of humiliation'; a huge pile of reiterated homilies on the empti.
ness of renown', and the certainty of oblivion'? It is', indeed',
the empire of death'; his great shadowy palace', where he sits
in state', mocking at the relicks of human glory', and spreading
dust and forgetfulness on the monuments of princes'. How
idle a boast', after all', is the immortality of a name'! Time is
ever silently turning over his pages'; we are too much engrossed
by the story of the present', to think of the characters and
anecdotes that gave interest to the past'; and each age is a
volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten'. The idol of to-
day pushes the hero of yesterday out of our recollection'; and
will', in turn', be supplanted by his successor of to-morrow'.
“Our fathers',” says Sir Thomas Brown',
6 find their graves
in our short memories', and sadly tell us how we may be buried
in our survivers'.” History fades into fable'; fact becomes
clouded with doubt and controversy'; the inscription moulders
from the tablet'; the statue falls from the pedestal'.* Columns',
arches', pyramids', what are they but heaps of sand'-and their
epitaphs', but characters written in the dust'? What is the secu.
rity of the tomb', or the perpetuity of an embalmment'? The
remains of Alexander the Great', have been scattered to the
wind', and his empty sarcophagus" is now the mere curiosity of
a museum'.. “ The Egyptian mummies which Cambyses or
time hath spared', avarice now consumeth'; Mizraim cures
wounds', and Pharaoh is sold for balsams'."
What', then', is to ensure this pile which now towers above
me', from sharing the fate of inightier mausoleums'?" The
time must come when its gilded vaults', which now spring so
loftily', shall lie in rubbish beneath the feet'; when', instead of
the sound of melody and praise', the wind shall whistle through
the broken arches', and the owl hoot from the shattered tower'-
when the garish sunbeam shall break into these gloomy man.
sions of death'; and the ivy twine round the fallen column'; and
the foxglove hang its blossoms about the nameless urn', as if in
mockery of the dead'. Thus man passes away'; his name
perishes from record and recollection'; his history is as "a tale
that is told';' and his very monument becomes a ruin'.

On Subscribing for Books.
(Extract from Flint's Review of Dr. Emmons' Fredoniad.]
We are sensible', that many will think we have meddled with
a theme which is wholly below the dignity of criticism'.
We
do not think so'. We would not', without object', wound the
feelings of Mr. Emmons', nor of any man'; and it is painful
to us to say what our notion of duty compels us to say of this
work'. We should not have named the work', had it not
suggested to us thoughts that we deem equally true and im.
portant',' and remarks which we deem to be the appropriate
award of legitimate criticism'.
We know not how large an edition of this work was printed';
but there are four volumes of it', and the expense must have
been very considerable': Just so much patronage will be with-
drawn from some work of real merit'. We hear', and authors
hear', and editors hear', and projectors of new works hear',
and every literary man hears this grating and discordant
theme': “Indeed', sir', I cannot subscribe to your work'. I
am tormented', by day and by night', at home and abroad', in
the house and by the way', in church and on 'change', at fu.
nerals and at theatres', by subscription-papers'. Here have I
been applied to this day for my name for three new periodicals',
and four new books'. I am taxed beyond all enduring'. Sub-
scription rogues'! I had rather encounter a highwayman with
his pistols', than one of these fellows with his paper'."
appeal to you', my dear book-maker', if you have not heard all
this in substance a hundred times'. You need not tell us', that
it goes straight to your commune sensorium (common seat of
feeling) and the medullary marrow', with the causticity of vit.
riol'. What is the inference? “I must treat you all alike',
or subscribe',as I am in the good or the bad fit” '; -and probably
poet Emmons obtains your name', and a man of genius and
talents goes away mortified and rejected'.
Because ten thousand drivellers and fools are deserting the
plough and the work-bench', and merging good tinkers in bad
poets', and editors', and book-makers', shall the world go back
to the ages of barbarism'? Shall the press be suspended'?
Will you treat all the thousand prowlers', who are dispersed
over the country with subscription-papers', like a judgment of

locusts', alike'? We say' .. not'. We say', that literature is
necessary to every country that is not peopled with savages', or
slaves'. We say', that every man owes something', in the form
of support', to literature', as strictly as he does to liberty',
education', or religion'. You can no more disengage yourself
from this obligation', than from that of bestowing charity'.
Your judging and discriminating faculties were given you', to
enable you to select from the hundred applications for your
name in this way', those works which you ought to encourage'.
You ought to make it a matter of deliberation and conscience
to decide to whom you ought to give', and from whom with-
hold', your countenance and patronage'. If you have been
caught purchasing forty thousand verses of trash', shall you
crush the spirit of modest and ingenuous talent by neglect'?
If your lady has been taken in with pit-coal indigo', is it good
reason', that she should', therefore', forever after refuse to pur-
chase the real die'?
We hold the common objection', “ I am tormented to death
with subscriptions',” to amount', in substance', I to this admis-
sion': “I have a poor head', and', withal', am a good deal of a
Goth', and care very little about literature',, or any thing that
causes man to differ from the brute'. I know of no difference
between poet Emmons', and Bryant', or even Milton'. I am
told that there are geese and swans'; but', being of the former
breed myself', I take all fowls to belong to my class', and all
works that ask subscription', to be on the same footing'.
This is not the language of a patriot',a scholar', or a gen-
tleman'. A thousand ask patronage', and a thousand ask
charity'; and there are deserving and undeserving objects in
each class'. It is a duty', that you should exercise your best
judgment in making the proper discrimination'.
There is that in the preface of the Fredoniad', which', at the
first look', disarms criticism', and inspires pity'. But a weak',
undistinguishing pity'; founded on animal tenderness and good
nature', is neither a rational' nor a benevolent sentiment'. True
benevolence is wise in its views'. This gentleman says', he
was cautioned against writing these verses', and found no en-
couragement except from one man'. Why did he not heed the
caution'? Instead of furnishing the community with an argu-
ments against yielding its aid to literary efforts', he might have
administered pills', or cut down trees', or made chimneys', and
in a thousand ways have been usefully', and cheerfully', and

their powers', and interpret a six years' morbid excitement of a
weak brain', for the visitings of the muse', and', in consequence',
go on to blot and spoil such an immense amount of clean paper

They may', perhaps', deserve pity'; but duty requires', that

SECTION V.
On Natural and Fantastical Pleasures.--GUARDIAN.
It is of great use to consider the pleasures which constitute
human happiness, as they are distinguished into Natural and
Fantastical. Natural Pleasures I call those which, not depend-
ing on the fashion and caprice of any particular age or nation,
are suited to human nature in general, and were intended, by
Providence, as rewards for using our faculties agreeably to the
ends for which they are given us. Fantastical Pleasures are
those which, having no natural fitness, to delight our minds,
presuppose some particular whim or taste, accidentally prevail.
ing in a set of people, to which it is owing that they please.
Now I take it, that the tranquillity and cheerfulness with
which I have passed my life, are the effects of having, ever
since I came to years of discretion, confined my inclinations
to the former sort of pleasures. But, as my experience can be
a rule only to my own actions, it may probably be a stronger
motive to induce others to the same scheme of life, if they
would consider that we are prompted to natural pleasures, by
an instinct impressed on our minds by the Author of our na-
ture, who best understands our frames, and, consequently, best
knows what those pleasures are which will give us the least
uneasiness in the pursuit, and the greatest satisfaction in the
enjoyment of them. Hence it follows, that the objects of our
natural desires are cheap, and easy to be obtained ; it being a

easy: and the pleasure is heightened by the sense of having

NATURAL AND FANTASTICAL PLEASURES. 275
answered some natural end, and the consciousness of acting
in concert with the Supreme Governour of the Universe.
Under natural pleasures, I comprehend those which are uni.
versally suited, as well to the rational, as the sensual, part of
our nature.
And of the pleasures which affect our senses,
those only are to be deemed natural, that are contained within
the rules of re son, which is allowed to be as necessary an in-
gredient of human nature, as sense. And, indeed, excesses of
any kind, are hardly to be considered pleasures, much less
natural pleasures.
It is evident that a desire terminated in money, is fantastical.
So is the desire of outward distinctions, which bring no delight
of sense, nor recommend us as useful to mankind; and, also,
the desire of things merely because they are new or foreign.
Men who are indisposed to a due exertion of their higher facul.
ties, are driven to such pursuits as these, from the restlessness
of the mind, and the sensitive appetites being easily satisfied.
It is, in some sort, owing to the bounty of Providence, that, dis-
daining a cheap and vulgar happiness, they frame to themselves
imaginary goods, in which there is nothing that can raise de.
sire, but the difficulty of obtaining them. Thus, men become
the contrivers of their own misery, as a punishment to them-
selves, for departing from the measures of nature. Having, by
a habitual reflection on these truths, made them familiar, the
effect is, that I, among a number of persons who have de-
bauched their natural taste, see things in a peculiar light, which
I have arrived at, not by any uncommon force of genius, or
acquired knowledge, but only by unlearning the false notions
instilled by custom and education.
The various objects that compose the world, were, by nature,
formed to delight our senses; and, as it is this only that makes
them desirable to an uncorrupted taste, a man may be said
naturally to possess them, when he possesses those enjoyments
which they are fitted by nature to yield. Hence, it is usual
with me to consider myself as having a natural property in
every object that administers pleasurex to me. When I am in
the country, all the fine seats near the place of my residence,
and to which I have access, I regard as mine. The same I
think of the groves and fields where I walk, and muse on the
folly of the civil landlord in London, who has the fantastical
pleasure of draining dry rent into his coffers, but is a stranger
to the fresh air and rural enjoyments. By these principles, I
am possessed of half a dozen of the finest seats in England,

which, in the eye of the law, belong to certain of my acquaint-
ances, who, being men of business, choose to live near the
court.
In some great families, where I choose to pass my time, a
stranger would be apt to rank me with the domesticks; but, in
my own thoughts and natural judgment," I am master of the
house, and he who goes by that name, is my steward, who
eases me of the care of providing for myself the conveniences
and pleasures of life.
When I walk the streets, I use the foregoing natural maxim,
namely: “That he is the true possessor of a thing, who enjoys
it, and not he that owns it without the enjoyment of it;' and to
convince myself that I have a property in the gay part of all
the gilt chariots that I meet, which } regard as amusements
designed to delight my eyes, and the imagination of those kind
people who sit in them, gayly attired, only to please me, I find
that I have a real, they only an imaginary, pleasure, from
their exterior embellishments. Upon the same principle, I have
discovered that I am the natural proprietor of all the diamond
necklaces, the crosses, stars, brocades, and embroidered clothes
which I see at a play or a birthnight, as they give more natural
delight to the spectator, than to those that wear them. And I
look on the beaus and ladies as so many paroquets in an aviary,
or tulips in a garden, designed purely for my diversion. A
gallery of pictures, a cabinet, or a library, that I have free ac-
cess to, I think my own. In a word, all that I desire, is the
use of things, let who will have the keeping of them; by which

natural taste, than unknown faces of Dutch gambols, though
done by the best masters. My couches, beds, and window-cur.
tains, are of Irish stuff, which those of that nation work very
fine, and with a delightful mixture of colours. There is not a
piece of china in my house; but I have glasses of all sorts, and
some tinged with the finest colours; which are not the less
pleasing because they are domestick, and cheaper than foreign
toys. Every thing is neat, entire, and clean, and fitted to the
taste of one who would rather be happy, than be thought rich.

THOUGHTS ON DEATH.
277
Every day, numberless innocent and natural gratifications
occur to me, while I behold my fellow-creatures labouring in a
toilsome and absurd pursuit of trifles : one, that he may
be
called by a particular appellation; another, that he may wear
a particulars ornament, which I regard as a piece of riband, that
has an agreeable effect on my sight, but is so far from supply.
ing the place of merit, where merit is not, that it serves only to
make the want of it more conspicuous. Fair weather is the
joy of my soul. About noon, I behold a blue sky with rap.
ture, and receive great consolation from the rosy dashes of
light which adorn the clouds both morning and evening. When
I am lost among the green trees, I do not envy a great man,
with a great crowd at his levee. And I often lay aside thoughts
of going to an opera, that I may enjoy the silent pleasure of
walking by moonlight, or viewing the stars sparkling in their
azure ground; which I look upon as part of my possessions,
not without a secret indignation at the tastelessness of mortal
men, who, in their race through life, overlook the real enjoy-
ments of it.
But the pleasure which naturally affects a human mind with
the most lively and transporting touches, I take to be the sense
that we act in the eye of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness,
that will crown our virtuous endeavours here, with a happiness
hereafter, large as our desires, and lasting as our immortal
souls. This is a perpetual spring of gladness in the mind. This
lessens our calamities, and doubles our joys. Without this,
the highest state of life is insipid; and with it, the lowest is a
paradise.
SECTION VI.
Thoughts on Death.-LORD Bacon.
I HAVE often thought upon death'; and I find it the least of
all evils'. All that is past', is as a dream'; and he that hopes
or depends upon time to come', dreams awake'. As much of
our life as we have already discovered', is already dead'. All
those hours which we enjoy', even from the breasts of our
mother until we return to our grandmother the earth', are our
dying days'; for we die daily': and as others have given place
to us', so must we', in the end', give way to others'.
I know many wise men who fear to die'; for the change is

bitter', and flesh is loath to prove it': besides', the expectation
of it brings terrour'; and that exceeds the evil'. I do not be.
lieve that any man fears to be dead'. He fears only the stroke
of death'. I cherish the hope', that if Heaven be pleased to
renew my lease but for twenty-one years more', I shall then',
without asking longer life', be strong enough to acknowledge,
without mourning', that I was born a mortal'.
Why should man be in love with his fetters', though of
gold"? Art thou drowned in security'? Then thou art per.
fectly dead'; for though thou movest', yet thy soul is buried
within thee', and thy good angel either forsakes his guard', or
sleeps'. There is nothing under the heaven', save a true
friend', unto which my heart leans'. Religious freedom hath
begotten me this peace', that I mourn not for that end which
must be'; nor do I spend one wish to have one minute added
to the uncertain date of my years'.
Were we to observe even the heathen maxim', “memento
mori',” (“ remember death',”) we should not become benighted
with this seeming', earthly félicity'; but enjoy it as those pre-
pared to give it up at the bidding of the great Donor', and not
intwine our thoughts and affections around so perishing a for-
tune'. How can any one but the votary of pleasure', be un.
ready to quit the veil and false visage of his mortal perfection?
The soul', when she has shaken off her fiesh', will set up', or',
rather', be set up', for herself'. The souls of idiots are doubt.
less composed of the same materials as those of statesmen".
Now and then nature is at fault', being thwarted in her opera
tions'; and this goodly guest of ours takes lodgment in an im-
perfect body', and is thus prevented from displaying her won-
ders': like an excellent musician', who cannot perform well on
a defective instrument'.
But see how I am swerved, and thrown out of my course',
by touching upon the soul', which', of all things', has the least
to do with death'. His style is the end of all flesh', and the
opening to incorruption'. This ruler of monuments' leads his
victims', for the most part', out of this world with their heels
forward', thereby giving token that his course is contrary to
life'.
Men enter headlong upon the wretched theatre of life', where
their first act opens in the language of mourning'. I cannot
more fitly compare man to any thing than to the Indian fig.

its branches down to the earth'; and there', by a new concep-
tion', they form new roots', and send up a fresh stock'. So',
man', having sprung originally from the earth', passes his tem.
poral life like a plant', sustaining himself and growing vigorous
by nourishment drawn from the earth', until made ripe for
death', he tends downwards', and is sown again in his mother
earth', where he perishes not', but expects a quickening'. Thus
we see', that death deprives us not of existence',. but merely
subjects us to a change'.
Death finds not a worse friend than an alderman', to whose
door I never knew him welcome'. But he is an importunate
guest', and will not be said này'. Even though the master of
the house himself should affirm that he is not within',
answer will not be taken'. What heightens his fear is', he
knows he is in danger of forfeiting his flesh', not being pre-
pared for the payment day': and the sickly uncertainty with
which he is to step out of the world', quite unfurnished for his
general, account', makes him desire to retain his gravity and
place', and prepare his soul to answer in scarlet'.
I gather', that death is disagreeable to most men', because
they die intestate': for there is a prevailing superstition among
them', that', when their will is made', they are nearer the grave
than before'. Now they think to scare destiny', from which
there is no appeal', by not making a will'; and endeavour to
lengthen life', by a protestation of their unwillingness to die'.
They who are well-seated in this world', whose fortune looks
towards them with a smile', are willing to anchor at its side',
and desire to put the evil day far off', and to postpone the un-
grateful time of their exit'. Nò'; these are not the men who
have bespoken death'. By their looks', they appear not to en-
tertain a thought of him'.
Death arrives graciously only to such as sit in darkness', or
lie heavily burdened with grief and irons':-To the poor Chris- .
tian', that sits bound in the galley'; to despairing widows',
pensive prisoners', and deposed kings':-to them whose for
tune runs back', and whose spirit mutinies'. To such', death
is a redeemer', and the grave a place of desired rest'. These
wait
upon
the shore', and beckon death to draw near', wishing',
-above all th to see his star', and be led to his place':
wooing the remorseless sisters', to draw out the thread of their
life', and break it off before their hour'.
But death is a doleful messenger to a usurer', and fate untime-
ly cuts his thread'. Death is never mentioned by him', except

when rumours of war and civil tumult remind him of his
grim approach'. When many hands are armed', and the peace
of the city is in disorder', and the foot of the common soldier
sounds an alarm on his stairs', then', perhaps', broken in thoughts
of his moneys abroad', and cursing the monuments of coin in
his house', he is willing to think of death': and', hasty of per •
dition', will doubtless hang himself", lest his throat be cut'; pro-
vided he may do it in his counting-room', surrounded with his
wealth', towards which his eye sends a languishing salute', even
at the turning off"; reserving', always', that he have time and
liberty in writing to depute himself as his own heir': for this is
a great peace to his end', and wonderfully reconciles him upon
the point'.
For my part', I think that nature would do me great wrông',
were I to be as long in dying as I was in being born'; but that
is', doubtless', not a point for me to settle'. In truth', no man
knows the lists of his own patience', nor can any one divine
how able he will be to endure suffering', till the storm comes',
this virtue being tested only in action. But out of a respect
for doing the most important business well, I would always
keep a guard', and stand upon having faith and a good con-
science'. If wishes could find place', I would die all together',
and not my mind often', and my body but once'; that is', 1
would prepare for the messenger of death', for sickness and
affliction', and not be compelled to wait long', or be tempted by
the violence of pâin'. Herein I do not profess to be a stoick',
and hold grief no evil', but an opinion', and a thing indifferent'.
With Cesar', I grant that the quickest passage is the easiest'.
There is nothing which more readily reconciles us to death',
than a quiet conscience',, and the belief that we shall be well
spoken of by virtuous survivers', and enter upon a rich harvest
of immortality'. But what is more insupportable', than evil
fame deserved'; or who can see worse days than he who', liv-
ing', is compelled to follow at the funeral of his reputation? I
have laid up many hopes that I shall be privileged from that
kind of mourning'; and I wish the same privilege to extend to
all with whom I
love'.
Death is our friend'; and he that is not prepared to entertain
him', is not at home'. Though ready for hin', I do not wish to
forestall his coming'. 'I wish nothing but what may better my
days': nor do I desire any greater place than the front of good
opinion'. Therefore', ' I make not love to the continuance of

days'; but to the goodness of them'. Nor do I wish to die',
but refer myself to my hour which the great Dispenser of all
things has appointed me': yet', as I am frail', and have suffer-
ed for my first fault', were* it given me to choose', I should not
be anxious to see the evening of my days', that extremity being
a disease of itself', a return to mere infancy'. Hence', if
perpetuity of life were offered me', I should concur with the
Greek poet', who said', that “Such an age would be a mortal
evil'.'
Men fear death', as children fear to go in the dark'; and as
that natural fear in children is increased by tales', so is the
other'. Certainly', the contemplation of death', as the wages
of sin', and the passage to another world', is holy and reli-
gious'; but the fear of it', as a tribute due to nature', is weak'.
In religious meditations', there is sometimes a mixture of vanity
and superstition'. In some of the friars' books on mortifica-
tion', you are directed to reflect upon the pain you would expe-
rience', if only one of your fingers' ends were pressed or tor-
tured', and thus imagine what the pains of death are when the
whole body is corrupted and dissolved'; and yet', death often
passes with less pain than is felt in the torture of a limb'; for
the most vital parts are not always the most sensitive'. By him
who spoke only as a philosopher and a natural man', it was
well said', “ Pompa mortis magis terret quam mors ipsa',
(“ The pageantry of death terrifies more than death itself':')
It is worthy of remark', that there is no passion in the mind
of man so weak', but it masters the fcar of death'. Revenge'..
triumphs over death"; love'. . slights it'; honour'.. aspires to it';
nay', we read that on the death of Otho the emperour', who
slew himself', pity', the tenderest of all passions', incited many
to die out of mere compassion for their sovereign'. It is no less
worthy of our attention', to observe how little alteration is made
upon good spirits by the approaches of death'; for they seem to
be the same to the last moment'. Augustus Cesar, died in a
compliment': “Livia', remember our marriage', and live':...
farewell';” Tiberius', according to Tacitus', died in dissimula-
tion': “ Now his strength and body', not his dissimulation', de-
serted him ';" Vespasian', in a jest':-Galba', with a magnani-
mous sentiment': “Feri', si ex re sit populi Romani";" ("Strike',
if it be for the good of the Roman people';'') Septimus Severus',
in despatch': “Adeste', si quid mihi restat agendum';" ("Has-
ten', if any thing remains to be done for me','') and the like'.

perhaps the one is as painful as the other'. He that dies in an
earnest pursuit', is like one that is wounded in hot blood', who',
for the time', scarcely feels the hurt'. Therefore a mind bent

Thus spoke the Christian philosopher'; but', on this theme',
no philosopher ever poured forth such a sublime strain of tri-
umphant rapture', as that uttered by the great apostle of the
Gentiles': “I am now ready to be offered'; and the time of my
departure is at hand'. I have fought a good fight'; I have
finished my course'; I have kept the faith'. Henceforth there
is laid up for me a crown of righteousness', which the Lord',
the righteous Judge', will give me at that day': and not to me

deity from these fashionable artists: even Jupiter himself was
hardly considered orthodox and worship-worthy, unless emana-

Juno, Venus, Minerva, and Diana, it was admitted that they had
a peculiar knack in their manufacture; and, it needs hardly be
added, they drove a thriving trade in these popular goddesses.
But this monopoly proved more favourable to the fortunes than
to the happiness of the parties. By constantly straining above
humanity, and aspiring to the representation of celestial beauty;
-by fostering the enthusiasm of their imaginations in the pur.
suit of the beau ideal,* they acquired a distaste, or, at least, an
indifference, a for mortal attractions, and turned up their noses
at their fair country-women, for not being Junoes or Minervas.

up in their imaginations, and not one of them, consequently,
would they deign to notice. At the publick games, the women
were all huddled together, whispering and looking glum, while
the men congregated as far from them as possible, discussing
the beau ideal. Had they been prosing upon politicks, you
might have presumed it an English or an American party.
Dancing was extinct, unless the ladies chose to lead out one
another; the priests waxed lank and wo-begone for want of the
marriage offerings. Hymen's altar was covered with as many
cobwebs as a poor's box: successive moons rose and set with-
out a single honey-moon, and the whole island threatened to
become an anti-nuptial colony of old bachelors and old maids.
In this emergency, Pygmalion, the most eminent statuary of
the place, falling in love with one of his own works, a figure
of Diana, which happened to possess the beau ideal in perfec-
tion, implored Venus to animate the marble ; and she, as is well
known to every person conversant with authentick history,
immediately granted his request. So far as this couple were
concerned, one would have imagined that the evil was remedied ;
but, alas! the remedy was worse than the disease. The model
of excellence was now among them, alive and breathing; the
men were perfectly mad, beleagiring the house from morn to
night to get a peep at her; all other women were treated with
positive insult; and, of course, the whole female population was
possessed by the furies. Marmorea (such was the name of the
animated statue) was no Diana in the flesh, whatever she might
have been in the marble; for, if the scandalous chronicles of
those days may be believed, she had more than one favoured
lover. Certain it is, that she was the cause of constant feuds and
battles, in which many lives were lost, and Pygmalion himself
was at last found murdered in the neighbourhood of his own
house. The whole island was now on the point of civil war, on
account of the philanthropical Helen, when one of her disappoint-
ed wooers, in a fit of jealousy, stabbed her to the heart, and
immediately after threw himself from a high rock into the sea.

loveliness that is not deemed defective. Anamaboo, the African
prince, received so many attentions from a celebrated belle of
London, that, in a moment of tenderness, he could not refrain
from laying his hand on his heart, and exclaiming, “ Ah!
madam, if heaven had only made you a negress, you would
have been irresistible.” And the same beauty, when travelling
among the Swiss Cretins, heard several of the men ejaculating,
“ How handsome she is! what a pity that she wants a Goitre."*
Plain women were formerly so common, that they were
termed ordinary to signify the frequency of their occurrence:
in these happier days the phrase extraordinarya would be more
applicable. However parsimonious, or even cruel, nature may
have been in other respects, they all cling to admiration by
some solitary tenure that redeems them from the unqualified
imputation of unattractiveness. One has an eye that, like
charity, covers a multitude of sins; another is a female Samp.
son, whose strength consists in her hair; a third holds your
aſſections by her teeth; a fourth is a Cinderella, who wins
hearts by her pretty little foot; a fifth makes an irresistible ap-
peal from her face to her figure, and so on to the end of the
catalogue. An expressive countenance may always be claimed
in the absence of any definite charm; and, if even this be ques.
tionable, the party generally contrives to get a reputation for
great cleverness ; and, if that be too inhumanly disputed, envy
itself must allow that she is “excessively amiable."
Still, it must be acknowledged, that however men may differ
as to details, they agree as to results, and crowd about an ac-
knowledged beauty, influenced by some secret attraction of
which they are themselves unconscious, and of which the
source has never been duly explained. It would seem impossi-
ble that it should originate in any sexual sympathies, since we
feel the impulsion without carrying ourselves, even in idea, be-
yond the pleasure of gazing, and are even sensibly affected by
the sight of beautiful children: yet it cannot be an abstract
admiration, for it is incontestable that neither men nor women
are so vehemently impressed by the contemplation of beauty
in their own, as in the opposite, sex.
This injustice towards our own half of humanity, might be
assigned to a latent envy, but that the same remark applies to ·
the pleasure we derive from statues, of the proportions of which
we could hardly be jcalous. Ugly statues may be left to their
fate without any compunctious visitings of nature;e but our

conduct towards women, whom we conceive to be in a similar
predicament,* is by no means entitled to the same indulgence.

What a blessing for these unhandsome damsels, whom we
treat still more unhandsomely by our fastidious neglect, that
some of us are less squeamish in our tastes and more impartial
in our attentions. Solomon proves the antiquity of the adage-
“ De gustibus nil disputandum,” (“The taste is not to be dis-
puted,”) for he compares the hair of his beloved, to a flock of
goats appearing from Mount Gilead ; and in a strain of enam-
oured flattery, exclaims : “ Thy eyes are like the fish-pools
in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose like the
tower of Lebanon, looking towards Damascus."
Now I deem it as becoming to see a woman standing behind
a good, roomy nose, as to contemplate a fair temple with a
majestick portico; but it may be questioned whether a nose like
the tower of Lebanon, is not somewhat too clephantine, and
bordering on the proboscis. The nez retroussé* (na re-troo'-sa)
is smart and piquant; the button-nose, like all other diminu-
tives, is endearing; and even the snub absolutely has its admi-
rers. Cupid can get over it, though it have no bridge ; and he
jumps through a wall-eye like a harlequin. As to the latter
feature, my taste may be singular, perhaps bad, but I confess
that I have a penchantt for that captivating cast, sometimes in.

In the connubial lottery, ugly women possess an advantage to

each other; and many ingenious theorists,' attempting to solve
the problem by attributing it to sympathy, contemplation of one
another's features, congeniality of habits, modes of life, and so
forth, have fallen into the very common errour of substituting
the cause for the effect. This mutual likeness is the occasion,
not the result, of marriage. Every man, like Narcissus, be.
comes enamoured of the reflection of himself, only choosing a
substance instead of a shadow. His love for any particular
woman, is self-love at second-hand, vanity reflected, compound

"
he exclaims: "How intelligent, how amiable, how interesting-
how admirably adapted for a wife!” and forthwith makes his
proposals to the personage so expressly and literally calculated
to keep him in countenance. The uglier he is, the more need
he has of this consolation. He forms a romantick attachment
to the “ fascinating creature with the snub nose," or the “ be-
witching girl with the roguish leer," (Anglice, squint,) without
once suspecting that he is paying his addresses to himself, and
playing the inamorato before a looking-glass. Take self-love
from love, and very little remains: it is taking the flame from
Hymen's torch, and leaving the smoke.
The same feeling extends to his progeny. He would rather
see them resemble himself, particularly in his defects, than be
modelled after the chubbiest cherubs or cupids that ever ema-
nated from the studio of Canova. One sometimes encounters
a man of a most unqualified hideousness, who obviously con-
siders himself an Adonis; and when such a one has to seek a
congenial Venus, it is evident that her will be in the in.
verse ratio of her charms. Upon this principle, ugly women
will be converted into belles; perfect frights will become irre-
sistible; and none need despair" of conquests, if they have but
the happiness to be sufficiently plain.
“ The best part of beauty,” says Lord Bacon," is that which
a statue or painting cannot express.” As to symmetry of form,
and superficial grace, sculpture is exquisitively perfect; but the
countenance is of too subtle and intangible a character to be
arrested by any modification of marble. Busts, especially where
the pupil of the eye is unmarked, have the appearance of mere
masks, and are representations of little more than blindness and
death. Painting supplies, by colouring and shade, much that
sculpture wants; but, on the other hand, it is deficient in what
its rival possesses — fidelity of superficial form. Nothing can
compensated for our inability to walk round a picture, and
choose various points of view. Facility of production, mean.
ness of material, and vulgarity of association, have induced us
to look down with unmerited contempt upon those waxen busts
in the perfumers' shops, which, as simple representations of
female nature, have attained a perfection that positively amounts
to the kissable. That delicacy of teint and material, which so
admirably adapts itself to female beauty, forms, however, but a
milk-maidish representation of virility; and the men have, con-
sequently, as epicene and androgynous an aspect as if they had
just been bathing in the Salmacian fountain.

of sense, and the dazzling prizes of ambition, the man of the
world scarcely recognises himself as the possessor of a spirit-
ual nature; in him
“This faculty divine
Is chained and tortured, -cabined, cribbed, confined,
And bred in darkness ;'**
but even over this darkness the truth will sometimes shine forth,
"The beam pour in, and time and skill will couch the blind."
In the infinite variety of his works and ways, the Almighty
has provided numerous means for maintaining a strong sense of
the supernatural. A mind of even ordinary, energy, natur.
ally turns inward when withdrawn from its daily routine of
thought and action; and when placed under circumstances of
powerful association, or, when witnessing striking phenomena
in the natural or moral world, it readily reverts to its own
origin and destiny, and spontaneously claims kindred with the
spiritual. Amid the solitude of ancient grandeur, the traveller
feels as if he were encircled by its former tenants ;-he ac-
knowledges the power and magick of the ruined battlement ;"
and,“ becoming a part of what has been," he recognises, in
the sacred awe which breathes around him, the force of the re-
mark, that
"There is given
Unto the things of earth which time has bent,
A spirit's feeling."
But it is not merely by its own creations that the mind feels
its connexions with the spiritual world. There are events and
scenes in nature so rare in their occurrence, or so overpowering
in their grandeur, or so terrifick in their effects, that the mind
springs, as it were, its earthly cable, and feels itself in the im.
mediate presence of more exalted intelligences. Amid the dark-
ness and crash of the thunder-storm, human courage stands
appalled, and we feel as if the divine ubiquity were concen.
trated in this powerful appeal to our fears. In the still more ter-
rifick phenomena of the earthquake, the poet has well described
"The awe
Which reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds
Plunge into the clouds for refuge, and withdraw
From their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds
Stumble o'er heaving plains; and man's dread hath no words."
Nor is it by material phenomena only that the mind is with-
drawn from its earthly concerns to a due sense of its positions

Such are
and its relations. Moral events address themselves still more
powerfully to mankind; and through the channel of the affec.
tions, we are often rodsed from a lethargy that would otherwise
prove fatal. When domestick affliction presses its cold hand
upon the heart, and throws a blackness over nature, material
objects almost cease to influence us; the mind discovers its true
place in the scheme of infinite wisdom, and, longing to follow

some of the means by which ordinary minds are impressed with
a serious, though unacknowledged, awe of the unseen world.
The various phenomena of apparitions may be divided into
two great classes :-Those which may be seen by several per-
sons at the same time ;-and those which are seen by only one
person at a time.
The first of these divisions embraces two very opposite classes
of phenomena. While it includes the supernatural visions which
were displayed during the Jewish theocracy, and at the estab.
lishment of Christianity,' it comprehends, also, the whole sys.
tem of imposture which prevailed in the heathen temples. The
extraordinary manner in which the Almighty deigned to hold
converse with his peculiar people, and the miracles by which
our Saviour and his disciples overpowered the incredulity of
their hearers, were special interpositions of Providence, rendered
for the accomplishing of the high objects of divine government.
But far different from these beneficente revelations, were the
lying miracles of ancient idolatry. The sciences of the times,
limited as they were, became, in the hands of the priest and
the magician, the unhallowed instruments' of imposture, with
which to operate upon the minds of the ignorant and the credu-
lous: and thus, the common people, unacquainted with the
powers of nature, and the resources of art, became the willing
victims of a base superstition.
The principal apparitions of former times, seem to have been
of an optical nature. The properties of lenses and concave
mirrors, and especially that of forming images in the air which
eluded the
grasp of the observer, and possessed all the charac-
teristicks of an incorporeal existence, were certainly known to
the ancient magicians. Hence, it was easy to obtain from in.
verted and highly illuminated statues and pictures, aerial repre-
sentations of their gods and heroes, or of their departed friends.

their prototypes, they still wanted the appearance of real life.
This defect, however, they were able to supply. They possessed
the art of giving an erect position to inverted images, so that it
was easy to exhibit* erect apparitions in the air.
Other sources of such apparitions as may be seen by several
persons at once, have their origin in particular functions of
vision itself; and to the deceptions which spring from them, the
best and the least informed are equally liable. The thousand
and one apparitions, which, from age to age, have continued to
terrify the young and the ignorant, have generally presented
themselves during the hours of twilight and darkness; at which
hours the imagination steps in as an auxiliary to physical
At such times, all objects, from the obscurity in which
they are involved, are seen with difficulty. This obscurity of
objects, combined with certain affections and singular changes
wrought upon the organs of vision, powerfully contributes to
the production of illusions in the dark. It is a curious circum-
stance, that the spectres of this kind, are always, as they ought
to be, white, because no other colour can be seen in the dark;
and they are always created, either out of inanimate objects
which reflect more light than those around them, or which are
projected against a more luminous ground, or they are formed
out of human beings or animals whose colour or change of
place renders them more visible in the dark.

Philosophy of Apparitions--Continued.-Ib.
That class of apparitions which can be seen only by one
person at a time, may originate in three different causes. First,
they may be the result of mere optical illusion, presented to a
person of the soundest mind and in the most perfect health; or
of certain physical affections of the eye, occasioned by some
temporary derangement of its functions, and exaggerated by
the imagination. Secondly, they may have their origin entirely
in the imagination when rendered morbid by an early-instilled
and deeply-seated belief in apparitions, and when excited by
local associations. Thirdly, they may arise, in persons of the
soundest minds and with the best regulated imaginations, from
a diseased state of the vital functions,-exhibiting themselves
in open day, and even in the midst of the social circle.

One of the most extraordinary illusions of the description last
mentioned, is that of Nicolai, a bookseller of Berlin, who com-
municated an account of his own case to the Prussiana Aca-
demy of Science.
Towards the close of the year 1790, and at the commence-
ment of 1791, M. Nicolai had been agitated by various misfor-
tunes which preyed deeply upon his mind, when, on the 24th of
February, an event occurred which threw him into still deeper
distress. At about ten o'clock in the morning, just as his wife
and a friend were entering his room for the purpose of consoling
him, he perceived, at the distance of a few paces, the standing
figure of a person deceased, which remained from seven to
eight minutes, and which the rest of the party, of course, were
unable to see. A little after four o'clock in the afternoon, the
same figure appeared to him when he was alone; and
upon
his
going out, in order to mention the circumstance to his wiſe, the
spectre accompanied him to her apartment, alternatelyd vanish-
ing and reappearing. A little after six o'clock, several stalking
figures also appeared ; but they had no connexion with the fig.
ure already mentioned.
When his mind had become more composed, and his bodily
indisposition had been removed by medical treatment, Nicolai
expected that these apparitions would take leave of him. His
expectations, however, were disappointed, for they increased
in number, and underwent the most extraordinary transforma-
tions. The standing figure of the deceased person never ap-
peared to him after the 24th of February; but several other
figures occupied its place. These figures were chiefly repre-
sentations of persons whom he did not know, though he some-
times saw those of his acquaintances. The figures of living
persons occurred more frequently than those of persons who
were deceased ; and he distinctly observed, that acquaintances
with whom he daily conversed, never appeared to him as phan-
tasms. Aſter some weeks, when he had become familiar with
these unbidden guests, he endeavoured to conjure up phantasms
of his acquaintances, by bringing them before his imagination
in the most lively manner; but, although he had, only a short
time previous, seen them as phantasms, by this process he never
could succeed in giving them an external locality.
When he was conversing with his physician and his wife, re-
specting the phantasms which hovered around him, the figures

would sometimes leave him altogether, and then appear again,
singly or in groups. The apparitions were generally human
figures of both sexes, which, like people at a fair, commonly
passed to and fro, as if they had no mutual connexion, though
they sometimes appeared to have business with one another. On
one or two occasions, he saw persons on horseback, dogs, and
birds, all of which appeared in their natural size, and of the
same colours which they exhibita in real life, though somewhat
paler.
When these apparitions began to be seen more frequently,
Nicolai began also to hear them speak. Sometimes they ad.
dressed one another, but generally they spoke to himself, in
short speeches, which never contained any thing disagreeable.
This loquacity in the apparitions, occurred most frequently when
he was alone, though he occasionally heard it in society, inter-
mixed with the actual conversation of the company.
Although these appearances had ceased to excite any disa-
greeable emotion, and had even afforded him frequent subjects
of amusement and mirth, yet as his disorder had sensibly in-
creased, and as the figures had appeared to him for whole days
together, and even when he awoke during the night, he found
it necessary, not only to take medicine, but also to apply leeches.
This was done on the 20th of April, at 11 o'clock in the fore-
noon; and, during the operation, while he was sitting alone
with the surgeon, the room swarmed with human forms of every
description, which crowded fast upon one another till half-past
four o'clock. The figures then began to move more slowly ;
their colours became gradually paler; and, after intervals of
seven minutes, he could distinguish a palpable diminution in their
intensity, without any change in the distinctness of their forms.
At about half-past six o'clock, they became entirely white, and
moved very slightly; their forms, however, were still perfectly
distinct, and, without decreasing in number, they gradually be-
came less perceptible. Instead of moving off or vanishing, as
they had usually done, they now dissolved immediately into air ;
whole pieces of some of them continuing for a length of time,
and at last disappearing. About eight o'clock, not a vestige of
them remained ; and Nicolai never again was disturbed by these
spectral illusions.
Accustomed to the investigation of mental phenomena, Nico-
lai took a great interest in studying the facts which had thus
occurred with himself; and he has recorded various, excellent

observations, of which the following are the most interesting to
the pneumatologist.
He could trace no connexion between the figures and the
state of his mind, the nature of his employments, or the course
of his thoughts previous to their appearance. He could always
clearly distinguish phantasms from real personages. The ap-
pearance of the phantasms was, in every instance, involuntary,
and not dependant on any external circumstances: whether he
was alone, or in society, whether in broad day-light, or in dark-
ness, whether in his own house, or that of a neighbour, their
appearance was equally distinct.
The figures sometimes disappeared when he shut his eyes,
and at other times they remained: when they vanished, in the
former case, nearly the same figures reappeared when his eyes
were again opened. The figures were neither terrible, ludic-
rous, nor repulsive; and they appeared more frequently in mo-
tion that at rest. On two or three occasions, after he had ceased
to observe these appearances, he felt a propensity to see the
again, or, rather, a sensation as if he saw them, but the sensa-
tion immediately left him without calling up the phantasms.
From a critical examination of Nicolai's case, it appeared
that the immediate cause of these spectral illusions, was a pe-
culiar derangement of the digestive organs. Other similar cases
are not unknown, and are found to proceed from the same cause.
So recently as in 1829, a very interesting case of the kind oc-
curred in England in the person of Mrs. A., which our restrict-
ed limits do not allow us to present.

Dr. Johnson's Letter to the Earl of Chesterfield.
My LORD: I have been lately informed by the proprietor of
the World, that two papers in which my Dictionary is recom-
mended to the publick, were written by your Lordship. To be
so distinguished, is an honour, which, being very little accus-
tomed to favours from the great, I know not well how to re-
ceive, or in what terms to acknowledge. When, upon some
slight encouragement," I first visited your Lordship, I was over.
powered, like the rest of mankind, by the enchantment of your
address; and could not forbear to wish that I might boast my.
self “the conqueror of the conqueror of the earth ;"—that I
might obtain that regard for which I saw the world contending :
but I found my attendance so little encouraged, that neither
pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it. When I had
once addressed your Lordship in publick, I had exhausted all
the art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly scholar can
possess. I had done all that I could; and no man is well
pleased to have his all neglected, be it ever so little.
Seven years, my Lord, have now passed since I waited in
your outward rooms, or was repulsed from your door; during
which time I have been pushing on my work through difficul.
ties, of which it is useless to complain, and have brought it, at
last, to the verge of publication, without one act of assistance,
one word of encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such
treatment I did not expect, for I never had a patron before.
The Shepherd in Virgil grew, at last, acquainted with Love,
and found him a native of the rocks.
Is not a patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on
a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached
ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have
been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been
kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent, and cannot
enjoy it; till I am solitary, and cannot impart it; till I am
known, and do not want it. I hope it is no very cynical as-
perity not to confess obligations where no benefit has been re-
ceived, or to be unwilling that the publick should consider me
as owing that to a patron, which Providence has enabled me
to do for myself.
Having carried on my work thus far, with so little obligation
to any favourer of learning, I shall not be disappointed though

pointed to an equally eminent station', I am compelled to sustain
the weight of others from which he is shielded by his noble
birth'. If he is guilty of neglect or a breach of trust', the
influence of his formidable connexions', the antiquity of his
family', the important services of his ancestors', and the mul.
titudes secured to his interest by the power of his wealth', all
tend to screen him from the hands of justice and the infliction
of condign punishment'; whereas', my safety depends wholly
upon myself. This renders it indispensably necessary', that
my conduct be pure' and unexceptionable'.
I am well aware', mya countrymen', that the eye of the
publick is upon me'; and that', although the impartial', who
prefer the real advantage of the commonwealth', to all other
considerations', favour my pretensions', yet the patricians de-
sire nothing more ardently than an accusation against me'.
It is my fixed resolution', therefore', to use my best endeavours
so to discharge the several duties of my office', that you shall

not be disappointed in me', and that their indirect designs
against me', shall be frustrated'.
From my youth', I have been familiar with toils and with
dangers'. When I served you for no reward but that of hon-
our', I was faithful to your interest': and now that
you
have
conferred upon me a place of profit', it is not my design" to
betray you'. You have committed to my charge the war
against Jugurtha'. At this', the patricians are offended'. But
where would be the wisdom of giving such a command to one
of their honourable body'?--to a person of illustrious bîrth',
of ancient family', of innumerable statues', but'... of no
EXPERIENCE'?c What service would his long line of dead an.
cestors', or his multitude of motionless statues', render his
country in the day of BATTLE'? What could such a general
do', amidst difficulties to which he himself is unequal', but', in
his trepidation and inexperience', have recourse for direction to
some inferiour commander'? Thus', your patrician general
would', in fact', have a general over him'; so that the acting
commander would still be a plebeian'. So true is this', my
countrymen', that I have myself known those who were chosen
consuls', then to begin to read the history of their own country',
of which', until that time', they were totally ignorant';e that is',
they first procured the office', and then bethought themselves
of the qualifications necessary for the proper discharge of its
duties'.
When a comparison is made between patrician haughtiness
and plebeiand experience', I submit it to your judgment', Ro.
mans', to determine on which side the advantage lies'. The
very actions of which they have only read', I have partly seen',
and partly myself achieved'. What they know by reading',
I know by experience. They are pleased to slight my mean
BIRTH': I despise their mean CHARACTERS'. Want of birth
and fortune is the objection against me': want of personal
worth', against them'. But', are not all men of the same spe.
cies'? What can make a difference between one man and
another', but the endowments of the mind'?
For my part,
I
shall always look upon the bravest man', as the noblest man'.
Suppose it were inquired of the fathers of such patricians as
Albinus', and Bestia', whether', were they to have their choice',
they would desire sons of their character', or of mine', what
would they answer', but', that they would wish the wörthiest to
be their sons'? If the patricians have reason to despise me', let

the fruit of their virtue'. Do they envy me the honours be-
stowed upon me'? Let them', likewise', envy my lâbours', my
abstinence', and the dangers I have undergone for my country',
by which I have acquired those honours'.
Those worthless men lead a life of so great inactivity as to
induce the belief that they despise any honours you can bestow',
whilst', at the same time', they as eagerly aspire to honours as
if they had deserved them by the most industrious course of
virtue'. They lay claim to the rewards of activity', for their
having enjoyed the pleasures of luxury'. Yet', none can be
more lavish than themselves in the praise of their ancestors'.
By celebrating their forefathers', they imagine that they honour
themselves'; whereas', they thereby do the very reverse'; for',
in proportion as their ancestors were* distinguished for their
virtues', are they disgraced by their vices'. The glory of an-
cestors sheds a light', indeed', upon their posterity'; but a light
which tends only to reveal the character of their descendants'.
It alike exhibits to publick view', both their degeneracy and
their worth'. I acknowledge that I cannot boast of the deeds
of my forefathers'; but I hope to answer the cavils of the
patricians by manfully defending what I have myself accom.
plished'.
Observe', now', my countrymen', the injustice of the patri.
cians'. They arrogate to themselves honours on account of the
exploits done by their forefathers', whilst they will not allow
me the due meed of praise for performing the very same kind
of heroick actions in my own person'. He has no statues of
his family', they exclaim'. He can trace back no line of ven.
erable ancestors'. What then'? Is it a subject of higher praise
for one to disgrace his illustrious ancestors', than to become
illustrious by his own noble behaviour'? What if I can show
no statues of my family'? I can exhibit the standards', the ar.
mour', and the trappings which I have myself taken from the
vanquished'. I can show the scars of those wounds which I
have received by facing the enemies of my country': These
are my statues'. These are the honours of which I boast'.
These were not left me by inheritance', d as theirs were';. but
they have been earned by toil', by abstinence', by acts of valour
amidst clouds of dust and seas of blood';-amidst scenes of
peril and carnage in which those effeminate patricians who', by
indirect means", endeavour to lower me in your estimation',
have never dared to show their faces'.

REPLY OF MR. PITT.
SECTION XV.
Reply of Mr. Pitt,
(The late Earl of Chatham,)
To the charge of youthful inexperience, and theatrical enunciation.
This illustrious father of English oratory, when a young member, hav.
ing expressed himself, in the House of Commons, with his accustomed
energy, in opposition to one of the measures then in agitation, his speech
produced an answer from Mr. Walpole, who, in the course of it, said,
* Formidable sounds and furious declamation, confidenta assertions and
lofty periods, may affect the young and inexperienced; and, perhaps, the
honourable gentleman may have contracted his habits of oratory by con-
versing more with those of his own age, than with such as have had more
opportunities of acquiring knowledge, and more successful methods of
communicating their sentiments.” He also made use of certain expres-
sions, such as “vehemenceb of gesture, theatrical emotion," and the like,
applying them to Mr. Pitt's manner of speaking. As soon as Mr. Walpole
sat down, Mr. Pitt got up, and replied:
The atrocious crime of being a yoûng mân', which', with so
much spirit and decency', the honourable gentleman has charged
upon me', I shall neither attempt to palliate', nor deny'; but
content myself with wishing', that I may be one of those whose
follies cease with their youth'; and not of that number who
are ignorant" in spite of experience'.
Whether yoûth can be imputed to any man as a reproach',
I will not assume the province of determining'; but', surely',
AGE may become justly contemptible', if the opportunities which
it brings', have passed away without improvement', and vice
appears to prevail when the passions have subsided'. The
wretch that', after having seen the consequences of a thousand
errours', continues still to blunder', and whose age has only
added obstinacy to stupidity', is surely the object of either ab-
horrence or contempt'; and deserves not that his gray head
should screen him from insults'. Much more is he to be ab.
horred', who', as he has advanced in age', has receded from
virtue', and becomes more wicked', with less temptation':-who
prostitutes himself for money which he cannot enjoy', and
spends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country'.
But youth is not my ônly crime'. I have been accused of
acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part may imply', either
some peculiarities of gesture', or a dissimulation of my real

sentiments',' and an adoption of the opinions and language of
another man'.
In the first sense', the charge is too trifling to be confuted';
and deserves only to be mentioned', that it may be despised'.
I am at liberty' (like every other man') to use my own lan-
guage': and though I may', perhaps', have some ambition',
yet', to please this gentleman', I shall not lay myself under
any restraint', or very solicitously copy his diction', or his
mien', however matured by age', or modelled by experience'.
If', by charging me with theatrical behaviour', any man mean
to insinuate that I utter any sentimentsa but my own', I shall
treat him as a calumniator and a VILLAIN': nor shall any pro-
tection shelter him from the treatment which he deserves'. On
such an occasion', I shall', without scruple', trample upon all
those forms with which wealth and dignity intrench them.
selves'; nor shall any thing but age', restrain my resentment':d
-age', which always brings one privilege'--that of being in-
solent and supercilious without punishment.
But', with regard to those whom I have offended', I am of
I
opinion', that', had I acted a borrowed part', I should have
avoided their censure'. The heat that offended them', is the
ardour of conviction', and that zeal for the service of my
country', which neither hope', nor fear', shall influence me to
suppress'. I will not sit unconcerned', while my LIBERTY is
invaded'; nor look in silence upon publick ROBBERY'. I will
exert my endeavours', at whatever hazard', to REPEL the ag-
gressor', and drag the thief to JUSTICE',—what
power SOEVER

SECTION XVII.
Extract from Mr. Webster's Speech in reply to Mr. Hayne,
in the Senate of the U. S. 1830.
The honourable gentleman argues', that if this government is
the sole judge of the extent of its own powers', whether that right
of judging is in congress', or the supreme court', it equally sub-
verts state sovereignty'. This the gentleman sees', or thinks he
sees', although he cannot perceive how the right of judging',
in this matter', if left to the exercise of state legislatures', has
any tendency to subvert the government of the Union'. The
gentleman's opinion may be', that the right ought not to have
been lodged with the general government'; he may like better',
such a constitution as we should have under the right of state
interference'; but I ask him to meet me on the plain matter of
fact'-I ask him to meet me on the constitution itself'- I ask
him', if the power is not found there'-clearly and visibly found
there'.
But', sir', what is this danger', and what the grounds of it'?
Let it be remembered', that the constitution of the United States',
is not unalterable'. It is to continue in its present form', no
longer than the people who established it', shall choose to con.
tinue it. If they shall become convinced', that they have made
an injudicious or inexpedient partition and distribution of powers
between the state governments and the general government',
they can alter that distribution at will'.
If any thing be found in the national constitution', either by
original provision', or subsequent interpretation', which ought
not to be in it', the people know how to get rid of it'. If any
construction be established', unacceptable to them', so as to be.
come', practically', a part of the constitution', they will amend
it at their own sovereign pleasure'. But while the people choose
to maintain it as it is'; while they are satisfied with it', and re-
fuse to change it'; who has given', or who can give', to the
state legislature', a right to alter it', either by interference', con-
struction', or otherwise'? Gentlemen do not seem to recollect',
that the people have any power to do anything for themselves';
they imagine there is no safety for them', any longer than they
are under the close guardianship of the state legislatures'. Sir',
the people have not trusted their safety', in regard to the general
constitution', to these hands'. They have required other secu-
rity', and taken other bonds'. They have chosen to trust them-
selves', first', to the plain words of the instrument', and to such
construction as the government itself, in doubtful cases', should

put on its own powers', under their oaths of office', and subject
to their responsibility to them': just as the people of a state',
trust their own state governments with a similar power'. Sec-
ondly,' they have reposed their trust in the efficacy of frequent
elections', and in their own power to remove their own servants
and agents', whenever they see cause'. Thirdly', they have
reposed trust in the judicial power', which', in order that it
might be trustworthy', they have made as respectable', as dis-
interested', and as independent', as was practicable'. Fourthly',
they have seen fit to rely', in case of necessity', or high expe-
diency', on their known and admitted power to alter or amend
the constitution', peaceably and quietly', whenever experience
shall point out defects or imperfections'. And', finally', the
people of the United States have', at no time', in no way',
directly or indirectly', authorized any state legislature to con-
strue or interpret their high instrument of government'; much
less to interfere by their own power', to arrest its course and
operation'.
If', sir', the people', in these respects', had done otherwise
than they have done', their constitution could neither have been
preserved', nor would it have been worth preserving'. And',
if its plain provisions shall now be disregarded', and these new
doctrines interpolated in it', it will become as feeble and helpless
a being as its enemies', whether early or more recent', could
possibly desire'. It will exist in every state', but as a poor
dependant on state permission'. It must borrow leave to BE',
and will be', no longer than state pleasure', or state discretion',
sees fit to grant the indulgence', and to prolong its poor exist-
But', sir', although there are fears', there are hopes also'.
The people have preserved this', their own chosen constitution',
for forty years', and have seen their happiness', prosperity', and
renown', grow with its growth', and strengthen with its strength'.
They are now', generally', strongly attached to it'. Overthrown
by direct assault, it can not be'; evaded', undermined', NULLI-
FIED', it will not be', if we, and those who shall succeed us
here', as agents and representatives of the people', shall con-
scientiously and vigilantly discharge the two great branches of
our publick trust'—faithfully to preserve and wisely to admin-
ister it'.
Mr. President', I have thus stated the reasons of my
dissent
to the doctrines which have been adyanced and maintained'. I
am conscious of having detained you and the senate much too
long'. I was drawn into the debate with no previous delibera-

ence'.

tion', such as is suited to the discussion of so grave and impor.
tant a subject'. But it is a subject of which my heart is full';
and I have not been willing to suppress the utterance of its
spontaneous sentiments'.
I cannot', sir', even now', persuade myself to relinquish this
subject' without expressing', once more', my deep conviction',
that since it respects nothing less than the Union of the States',
it is of the most vital and essential importance to publick happi.
ness'. I profess', sir', in my career hitherto', to have kept
steadily in view the prosperity and honour of the whole coun-
try', and the preservation of our Federal Union'. It is to that
Union we owe our safety at home', and our consideration and
dignity abroad'. It is to that Union that we are chiefly indebt-
ed for whatever makes us most proud of our country'. That
Union we reached', only by the discipline of our virtues', in the
severe school of adversity'. It had its origin in the necessities
of disordered finance', prostrate commerce', and ruined credit'.
Under its benign influences', these great interests immediately
awoke', as from the dead', and sprang forth with newness of
life'. Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs
of its utility and its blessings'; and', although our territory has
stretched out', wider and wider', and our population has spread
farther and farther', they have not outrun its protection', or its
benefits'. It has been to us all a copious fountain of national',
social', and personal happiness'.
I have not allowed myself, sir', to look beyond the Union',
to see what might lie hidden in the dark recess behind'. I have
not coolly weighed the chances of preserving liberty', when the
bonds that unite us together shall be broken asunder'. I have
not accustomed myself to hang over the precipice of disunion',
to see whether', with my short sight', I can fathom the depth of
the abyss below'; nor could I regard him as a safe counsellor
in the affairs of this government', whose thoughts should be
mainly bent on considering', not how the Union should be best
preserved', but how tolerable might be the condition of the
people when it shall be broken up and destroyed'.
While the Union lasts', we have high', exciting', gratifying
prospects spread out before us', for ourselves and our children'.
Beyond that', I seek not to penetrate the veil'. God grant',
that', in my day', at least', that curtain may not rise'.
God
grant, that', on my vision', never may be opened what lies be-
hind'. When my eyes shall be turned to behold', for the last
time', the sun in the heavens', may I not see him shining on the
broken and dishonoured fragments of a once glorious Union',

SECTION XVIII.
The Broken Heart.--İRVING.
EVERY one must recollect the tragical story of young Emmet', the Irish
patriot': it was too touching to be soon forgotten'. During the troubles
in Ireland, he was tried', condemned', and executed', on a charge of trea-
son'* His fate made a deep impression on publick sympathy'. He was so
young'-so intelligent'-o generous'-so brave'—so every thing that we
are apt to like in a young man'. His conduct under trial', too', was so
lofty and intrepid'. The noble indignation with which he repelled the
charge of treason against his country'—the cloquent vindication of his
name'-and his pathetick appeal to posterity', in the hopeless hour of con-
demnation' -all these entered deeply into every generous bosom', and even
his enemies lamented the stern policy that dictated his execution'.
But there was one heart', whose anguish it would be impossible to de-
scribe'. In happier days and fairer fortunes', he had won the affections of
a beautiful and interesting girl', the daughter of a late', celebrated Irish
barrister'.t She loved him with the disinterested fervour of a woman's
first and early love'. When every worldly maxim arrayed itself against
him'; when blasted in fortune', and disgrace and danger darkened around
his name', she loved him the more ardently for his very sufferings'. If",
then', his fate could awaken the sympathy even of his foes', what must
have been the agony of her whose whole soul was occupied by his image'?
Let those tell who have had the portals of the tomb suddenly closed be.
tween them and the being they most loved on earth'—who have sat at its
threshold', as one shut out in a cold and lonely world', from whence all
that was most lovely and loving had departed'.

But then', the horrours of such a grave!!-so frightful, so dishonoured":
There was nothing for memory to dwell on', that could sooth the pang
of separation'-none of those tender', though melancholy', circumstances',
that endear the parting scene'—nothing to melt sorrow into those blessed
tears', sent', like the dews of heaven', to revive the heart in the parting
hour of anguish:
To render her widowed situation more desolate', she had incurred her
father's displeasure by her unfortunate attachment', and was an exile from
the paternal roof'. But could the sympathy and kind offices of friends
have reached a spirit so shocked and driven in by horrour', she would have
experienced no want of consolation', for the Irish are a people of quick
and generous sensibilities. The most delicate and cherishing attentions
were paid her', by families of wealth and distinction'. She was led into
society'; and they tried by all kinds of occupation and amusement to dis-
sipate her grief', and wean her from the tragical story of her loves'. But
it was all in vain. There are some strokes of calamity that scath and
scorch the soul —that penetrate to the vital seat of happiness'-and blast
it', never again to put forth bud or blossom'. She never objected to fre-
quent the haunts of pleasure', but she was as much alone there', as in the
depths of solitude'. She walked about in a sad revery', apparently un-
conscious of the world around her! She carried with her an inward wo
that mocked at all the blandishments of friendship', and“ heeded not the
song of the charmer', charm he ever so wisely."
The person who told ine her story', had seen her at a masquerade'.
There can be no exhibition of far-gone wretchedness more striking and
painful than to meet it in such a scene! To find it wandering', like a
spectre', lonely and joyless', where all around is gay'—to see it dressed
out in the trappings of mirth', and looking so wan and wo-begone', as if
it had tried in vain to cheat the poor heart into a momentary forgetfulness
of sorrow'. After strolling through the splendid rooms and giddy crowd
with an air of utter abstraction', she sat herself down on the steps of an
orchestra', and looking about for some time with a vacant air', that show.
ed her insensibility to the garish scene', she began', with the capriciousness
of a sickly heart', to warble a little plaintive air'. She had an exquisite
voice'; but on this occasion', it was so simple —so touching-it breathed
forth such a soul of wretchedness',--that she drew a crowd', mute and si-
lent', around her', and melted every one to tears'.
The story of one so true and tender', could not but excite great inter-
est in a country remarkable for enthusiasm. It completely won the heart
of a brave officer', who paid his addresses to her', and thought', that one
so true to the dead', could not but prove affectionate to the living'. She
declined his attentions', for her thoughts were irrevocably engrossed by
the memory of her former lover'. He', however, persisted in his suit'.
He solicited not her tenderness', but her esteem'. He was assisted by her?

conviction of his worth', and her sense of her own destitute and depend-
ant situation', for she was existing on the kindness of friends'. In a word',
he at length succeeded in gaining her hand, though with the solemn as-
surance', that her heart was unalterably another's'.
He took her with him to Sicily, hoping that a change of scene might
wear out the remembrance of early woes' She was an amiable and ex-
emplary wife', and made an effort to be a happy one'; but nothing could
cure the silent and devouring melancholy that had entered into her very
soul'. She wasted away in a slow but hopeless decline', and at length
sank into the grave', the victim of a broken heart'.
It was on her that Mr. Moore', the distinguished Irish poet', composed
the following lines':
She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps',
And lovers around her are sighing';
But coldly she turns from their gaze', and weeps',
For her heart in his grave is lying':
She sings the wild song of her dear native plains',
Every note which he loved awaking -
Ah'! little they think', who delight in her strains',
How the heart of the minstrel is breaking!!
He had lived for his love'--for his country he died';
They were all that to life had intwined him'-
Nor soon shall the tears of his country be dried',
Nor long will his love stay behind him',
Oh'! make her a grave where the sunbeañs rest',
When they promise a glorious morrow';
They 'll shine o'er her sleep', like a smile from the west,
From her own loved island of sorrow'.

Endictment for High Treason.—Extract.

ed upon it.
I do not imagine that', seated where you are', your minds can
be so free from impurity as to receive the least impression from
what I am going to utter'. I have no hopes that I can anchor
my character in the breast of a court constituted and trammel-
led as this is'. I only wish', and it is the utmost I expect, that
your lordships may suffer it to float down your memories', un.
tainted by the foul breath of prejudice', until it finds some more
hospitable harbour to shelter it from the storms by which it is
at present buffeted'.
Were I only to suffer death', after being
adjudged guilty by your tribunal', I should bow in silence', and
meet the fate that awaits me without a murmur'; but the sen.
tence of the law', which delivers my body to the executioner',
will', through the ministry of that law', labour', in its own vin-
dication', to consign my character to obloquy'-for there must
be guilt somEWHERE'; whether in the sentence of the court', or
in the catastrophe', posterity must determine'.
A man in my situation', has to encounter', not only the diffi-
culties of fortune', and the force of power over minds which it
has corrupted or subjugated, but also the difficulties of establish-
ed prejudice'. The man dies', but his MEMORY lives'. That
mine may not perish', that it may live in the respect of my
countrymen', I seize upon this opportunity to vindicate myself
from some of the charges alleged against me'. When my spir.
it shall be waſted to a more friendly port',- -when
my
shade
shall have joined the bands of those martyred heroes who have
shed their blood on the scaffold and in the field', in defence of
their country and of virtue', this is my hope'—I wish that my
memory and name may animate those who survive me'; while
I look down with complacency on the destruction of that perfid-
ious government'. . which upholds its domination by blasphemy
of the Most High'—which displays its power over men'. . as
over the beasts of the forest'—which sets man upon his bro.
ther', and lifts his hand', in the name of God', against the throat
of his fellow'.. who believes or doubts a little more or a little
less than the government standard – a government'. . which is
steeled to barbarity by the cries of the orphans and the tears of
the widows which it has made'. [Here Lord Norbury inter.
rupted Mr. Emmet, saying, that those wicked enthusiasts who
felt as he did, were not equal to the accomplishment of their
wild designs.]

conduct has been', through all this peril', and through all my
purposes', governed only by the convictions which I have utter-
ed', and by no other motive than that of their cure', and the
emancipation of my country from the superinhuman oppression
under which she has so long and too patiently travailed'; and I
confidently hope', that', wild and chimerical as it may appear',
there are still union and strength in Ireland sufficient to accom-
plish this noblest enterprise'. Of this I speak with the confi.
dence of intimate knowledge', and with the consolation that apo
pertains to that confidence'. Think not', my lord', I
say
this
for the petty gratification of giving you a transitory uneasiness'.
A man who never yet raised his voice to assert a Lîs', will not
hazard his character with posterity by asserting a falsehood on
a subject so important to his country', and on an occasion like
this'. Yes', my lord', a man who does not wish to have his
epitaph written until his country is liberated', will not leave a
weapon in the power of ENVY to impeach the probity which he
means to preserve even in the grave to which tyranny consigns
him. [Here he was again interrupted by the judge.]
Again I say', that what I have spoken was not intended for
your lordship', whose situation I commiserate', rather than envy':
my expressions were for my countrymen'. If there is a true
Irishman present', let my last words cheer him in the hour of
affliction'. [Here he was again interrupted by the court.] I
have always understood it to be the duty of a judge', when a
prisoner has been convicted', to pronounce the sentence of the
law': I have also understood', that judges sometimes think it
their duty to hear with patience', and to speak with humanity';
to exhort the victim of the laws', and to offer', with tender be-
nignity', their opinions of the motives by which he was actuated
in the crime of which he had been adjudged guilty'—that a
judge has thought it his duty so to do', I have no doubt'; but
where is the boasted freedom of your institutions'—where is the
vaunted impartiality and clemency of your courts of justice', if
an unfortunate prisoner', whom your policy', not pure justice', is
about to deliver into the hands of the executioner', is not suffer.
ed to explain his motives sincerely and truly', and to vindicate
the principles by which he was actuated?
My lord', it may be a part of the system of angry justice
to bow a man's mind by humiliation to the purposed ignominy
of the scaffold': but worse to me than the purposed shame',
the scaffold's terrours', would be the shame of such foul and
unfounded imputations as have been laid against me in this

is the only legacy I can leave to those I honour and love', and
for whom I am proud to perish'. As men', we must appear', on

Oh', my country'! had it been personal ambition that influ.

by my education and fortune', by the rank and consideration
of my family', have placed myself amongst the proudest of
your oppressors'? My country was my idol'. To it I sacri- .
ficed every selfish', every endearing sentiment'; and for it I
now offer up my life'. No', my lord', I acted as an Irishman',
determined on delivering my country from the yoke of a foreign
and unrelenting tyranny', and from the more galling yoke of a
domestick faction, its joint partner and perpetrator in parricide',
whose rewards are the ignominy of existing with an exteriour
of splendour', and a consciousness of depravity'.
It was the wish of my heart to extricate my country from
this doubly riveted despotism'. I wished to place her inde-
pendence beyond the reach of any power on earth'. I wished
to exalt her to that proud station in the world which Providence
had destined her to fill'.
I have been charged with so great importance', in the efforts
to emancipate my country', as to be considered the key-stone of
the combination of Irishmen', or', as your lordship expressed
it', " the life and blood of the conspiracy'.” You do me honour
overmuch'—you have given to the subaltern all the credit of a
superiour'. There are men engaged in this conspiracy who
are not only superiour to me', but even to your own conceptions
of yourself', my lord -men before the splendour of whose
genius and virtues I should bow with respectful deference', and
who would think themselves dishonoured to be called your

Brutus' Harangue on the Death of Cesar.-SHAKSPEARE.
ROMANS', countrymen', and lovers'! hear me for my cause';
and be silent',
that
you may hear'. Believe me for
honour';
and have respect to my honour', that you may believe'. Cen.
sure me in your wisdom'; and awake your senses', that
you
may the better judge'. If there is any in this assembly', any
dear friend of Cesar's', to him I say', that Brutus' love to
Cesar was no less than his'. If", then', that friend demand why
Brutus rose against Cesar', this is my answer': Not that I loved
Cesar less', but that I loved Rome more'. Had you rather
Cesar were living', and die all SLÂVES', than that Cesar were
dead', to live all freemen'?—As Cesar loved me', I
weep for
him'; as he was fortunate', I rejoice at it'; as he was valiant',
I honour him'; but', as he was AMBITIOUS', I SLEw him'. There
are tears for his love', joy for his fortune', honour for his
valour', and DEATH for his AMBITION.-Who is here so base',
that he would be a bondman'? If any', speak'; for him I have
offended'. Who is here so rude', that he would not be a Ro.
man'? If any', speak'; for him I have offended'.-—Who is
here so vile', that he will not love his country'? If any', speak';
for him I have offended'.--I pause for a reply'-
None'! Then none have I offended'. I have done no more
to Cesar', than you shall do to Brutus'. The question of his
death is enrolled in the capitol'; his glory 'not extenuated',
wherein he was worthy'; nor his offences enforced', for which
he suffered death'.
Here comes his body', mourned by Mark Antony'; who',
though he had no hand in his death', shall receive the benefit
of his dying', a place in the commonwealth'; as which of you
shall not'?—With this', I depart'-and', as I slew my best lover
for the good of Rome', I have the same dagger for myself',
when it shall please my country to need my death'.

Antony's Oration over Cesar's Dead Body.-SHAKSPEARE.
FRIENDS', Romans', countrymen'! Lend me your ears'.
I come to bury Cesar', not to praise him'.
The evil that men do', lives after them';
The good is oft interred with their bones':
So let it be with Cesar'! Noble Brutus
Hath told you', that Cesar was ambitious'.
If it were so', it was a grievous fâult';
And grievously hath Cesar answered it'.
Here', under leave of Brutus and the rest',
(For Brutus is an honourable mân';
So are they all', all hônourable mên',)
Come I to speak in Cesar's funeral'.
He was my friend', faithful and just to me':
But Brutus says', he was ambitious';
And Brutus is an honourable mân'.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome',
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill':
Did this in Cesar seem ambitious'?
When that the pôôr have crîed', Cesar hath wept.
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious';
And Brutus is an honourable mân'.
You all did sec', that', on the Lupercal',
I thrice presented him a kingly crown';
Which he did thrice refuse': Was this ambition ?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious';
And', sure', he is an honourable man'.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke';
But here I am', to speak what I do know'.
You all did love him once'; not without cause';-
What cause withholds you then to môurn for him'?
O judgment'! Thou art fled to brutish beasts',
And men have lost their reason. -Bear with me':
My heart is in the coffin there with Cesar';
And I must pause till it come back to me'.
But yesterday the word', Cesar', might
Have stood against the world'! Now lies he there',
And none so poor [as] to do him reverence!
O Masters'! If I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage',
I should do Brutus wrong', and Cassius wrong,
Who', you all know', are honourable men'.
I will not do them wrong' — I rather choose
To wrong the dead', to wrong myself and you',
"Than I will wrong such hônourable men'.

ANTONY'S ORATION.

But here's a parchment', with the seal of Cesar.
I found it in his closet': 'tis his will',
Let but the commons hear this testament',
(Which', pardon me', I do not mean to read',)
And they would go and kiss dead Cesar's wounds',
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood'; .
Yea', beg a hậir of him for memory',
And', dying', mention it within their wills',
Bequeathing it', as a rich legacy',
Unto their issue'.
If you have têars', prepare to shed them now'.

The first time ever Cesar put it on';
'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent':
That day he overcame the Nervii-
Look'! In this place ran Cassius' dagger through
See what a rent the envious Casca made'-
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed';
And', as he plucked his cursed steel away',
Mark how the blood of Cesar followed it!
This', This was the unkindest cut of all!!
For when the noble Cesar saw him stab',
Ingratitude', more strong than traitor's arms',
Quite vanquished him! Then burst his mighty heart',
And in his mantle muffling up his face',
Even at the base of Pompey's statue',
Which all the while ran blood',) great Cesar FELL'.
O', what a fall was there', my countrymen!
Then I', and you', and all of us', fell down',
Whilst bloody treason flourished over us'.
O', now you weep'; and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity'These are gracious drops'.
Kind souls'! What', weep you when you but behold
Our Cesar's vesture wounded'? Look ye here!
Here is himself marred', as you see', by traitors'.
Good friends! Sweet friends! Let me not stir you up
To any sudden flood of mutiny'.
They that have done this deed, are hônourable'.
What private griefs they have', alas', I know not',
That made them do it'. They are wise and hônourable',
And will', no doubt', with reason answer you'.
I come not', friends', to steal away your hearts'!
I am no orator', as Brutus is';
But', as you know me all', a plain', blunt man',
That love my friend and that they know full well',
That gave me publick leave to speak of him!
For I have neither wit', nor words', nor worth',
Action', nor utterance', nor power of speech',
To stir men's blood'-I only speak right on'.

Show you sweet Cesar's wounds', poor', poor', dumb months,

For he to-day that sheds his blood with me',
Shall be my brother': be he e'ere so vile',

Last Parting of the three Indian Friends. -MOORE.
WHEN shall we three meet again?
When shall we three meet again?
Oft shall glowing hope expire,
Oft shall weary love retire,
Oft shall death and sorrow reign,
Erea we three shall meet again.
Tho' to distant lands we hie,
Parched beneath a burning sky,
Tho' the deep between us rolls,
Friendship still unites our souls;
And, in fancy's wide domain,
Oft shall we three meet again.
When those burnished locks are gray,
Thinned by many a toil-spent day,
When around this youthful pine
Moss shall creep and ivy twine,
Long may this loved hour remain,
Oft may we three meet again.
When the dream of life is fled,
When those wasting lamps are dead,
When, in cold oblivion's shade,
Beauty, wit, and power are laid,
Where immortal spirits reign,
There may we three meet again.

And restored every rose', but secreted its thorn'.

And bade the young dreamer in ecstasy rise!:-

To be'
'-or not to be that is the question';
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The stings and arrows of outrageous fortune'-
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles',
And', by opposing', end them'? To die'—to sleep'-
No more'?—and', by a sleep', to say we end
The heart-ache', and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to':'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished'. To die'-to sleep'-
To sleep'—perchance', to dream'-ay', there's the rub'-
For', in that sleep of death', what dreams may come',
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil',
Must give us pause'.—There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life';
For who could bear the whips and scorns of time',
Th'oppressor's wrong', the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love', the law's delay,
The insolence of office', and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes',
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin'? Who would fardels* bear',
To groan and sweat under a weary life',
But that the dread of something after death',
(That undiscovered country from whose bourn
No traveller returns',) puzzles the will',
And makes us rather bear those ills we have',
Than fly to others that we know not of'?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all!,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought';
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
With this regard', their currents turn away',
And lose the name of action'

[Laying his hand on his sword.
Thus I am doubly armed'. My death', and life',
My bane and antidote', are both before me'.
This', in a moment', brings me to an end';
But this informs me I shall never die':
The soul', secured in her existence', smiles
At the drawn dagger', and defies its point:
The stars shall fade away', the sun himself
Grow dim with age', and nature sink in years';
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth',
Unhurt amidst the war of elements,
The wreck of matter', and the crush of worlds'.

The Alhambra by Moonlight.- IRVING.
I HAVE given a picture of my apartment on my first taking
possession of it': a few evenings have produced a thorough
change in the scene and in my feelings'. The moon', which
then was invisible', has gradually gained upon the nights', and
now rolls in full splendour above the towers', pouring a flood
of tempered light into every court and hall'. The garden
beneath my window', is gently lighted up'; the orange and citron
trees'..a
.. are tipped with silver'; the fountain'.. sparkles in the
moonbeams'; and even the blush of the rose'. . is faintly visible'.
I have sat for hours at my window', inhaling the sweetness
of the garden', and musing on the checkered features of those
whose history is dimly shadowed out in the elegant memorials
around'. Sometimes I have issued forth at midnight'. . when
everything was quiet', and have wandered over the whole
building. Who can do justice to a moonlight night in such a
'
climate', and in such a place'! The temperature of an Anda-
Jusian midnight in summer', is perfectly ethereal'. We seem
lifted up into a purer atmosphere'; there is a serenity of soul',
a buoyancy of spirits', an elasticity of frame', that render mere
existence'd. . enjoyment'. The effect of moonlight', too', on the
Alhambra', has something like enchantmente. Every rent and
chasm of time', every mouldering teint and weather-stain', dis.
appears'; the marble resumes its original whiteness'; the long
colonnades brighten in the moonbeams'; the halls are illumin.
ated with a softened radiance', until the whole edifice reminds
one of the enchanted palace of an Arabian tale'. At such a
time', I have ascended to the little pavilion', called the queen's
toilette', to enjoy its varied and extensive prospect'. To the

defined'. My delight', however', would be to lean over the
parapet of the Tocador', and gaze down upon Granada',* spread
out like a map below me': all buried in deep repose', and its
white palaces and convents sleeping', as it were', in the moon.

Sometimes I would hear the faint sounds of castanets from

notes of a single voice'. . rising from some solitary street', and
have pictured to myself some youthful cavalier', serenading his
lady's window'; a gallant custom of former days', but now
sadly on the decline', except in the remote towns and villages
of Spain'.
Such are the scenes that have detained me for many an hour',
loitering about the courts and balconies of the castle', enjoying
that mixture of revery and sensation which steal away exist-
ence in a southern climate'--and it has been almost morning
before I have retired to my bed', and been lulled to sleep. by
the falling waters of the fountain of Lindaraxa'.

Reflections on the Moslem Domination in Spain.-Ib.
ONE of my favourited resorts is the balcony of the central
window of the Hall of Ambassadors', in the lofty tower of
Comares'. * I have just been seated there', enjoying the close
of a long', brilliant day'. The sun', as he sunk behind the
purple mountains of Alhama', sent a stream of effulgence up
the valley of the Darro , that spread a melancholy pomp over
the ruddy towers of the Alhambra', while the Vega', covered
with a slight', sultry vapour that caught the setting ray', seem.

was one of those hours and scenes in which memory asserts
an almost magical power', and', like the evening sun'.. beam-
ing on these mouldering towers', sends back her retrospective
rays to light up the glories of the past'.
As I sat watching the effect of the declining daylight upon
this Moorish pile', I was led into a consideration of the light',
elegant',, and voluptuous character prevalent throughout its
internal architecture, and to contrast it with the grand', but
gloomy', solemnity of the Gothick edifices', reared by the Span.
ish conquerors'. The very architecture thus bespeaks the oppo-
site and irreconcilable natures of the two warlike people who
so long battled here for the mastery of the Peninsula'. By
degrees', I fell into a course of musing upon the singular fea-
tures of the Arabian or Morisco Spaniards', whose whole exist-
ence is as a tale that is told', and certainly forms one of the
most anomalous', yet splendid', episodes in history'. Potenta
and durable as was their dominion', we have no one distinct
title by which to designate them. They were a nation', as it
were', without a legitimate country or a name'. A remote
wave of the great Arabian inundation', cast upon the shores of
Europe', they seemed to have all the impetus of the first rush
of the torrent'. Their course of conquest from the rock of
Gibraltar to the cliffs of the Pyrenees', was as rapid and bril-
liant as the Moslem victories of Syria and Egypt'. Nay', had
they not been checked on the plains of Tours', all France', all
Europe', might have been overrun with the same facility as the
empires of the east'; and the crescent might', at this day', have
glittered on the fanes of Paris and of London'.
Repelled within the limits of the Pyrenees', the mixed hordes
of Asia and Africa that formed this great irruption', gave up
the Moslem principles of conquest', and sought to establish' in
Spain a peaceful and permanent dominion'. As conquerors',
their heroism was only equalled by their moderation'; and in
both', for a time', they excelled the nations with whom they
contended'. Severed from their native homes', they loved the
land given them', as they supposed', by Allah', and strove to
embellish it with every thing that could administer to the happi.
ness of man'. Laying the foundations of their power in a
systems of wise and equitable laws', diligently cultivating the
arts and sciences', and promoting agriculture', manufactures',
and commerce', they gradually formed an empire'.. unrivalled

for its prosperity', by any of the empires of Christendom'; and
diligently drawing round them the graces and refinements that
marked the Arabian empire in the east at the time of its greatest
civilization', they diffused the light of oriental knowledge through
the western regions of benighted Europe':
The cities of Arabian Spain became the resort of Christian
artisans', in which to instruct themselves in the useful arts'.
The universities of Toledo, Cordova', Seville', and Granada',
were sought by the pale studenta from other lands', to acquaint
himself with the sciences of the Arabs', and the treasured lore
of antiquity'; the lovers of the gay sciences', resorted to Cor.
dova and Granada', to imbibe the poetry and musick of the
east'; and the steel-clad warriours of the north'.. hastened thither
to accomplish themselves in the graceful exercises and courteous
usages of chivalry'.
If the Moslem monuments in Spain';--if the Mosque of Cor.
dova', the Alcazar of Seville', and the Alhambra of Granada',
still bear inscriptions fondly boasting of the power and perma-
nency of their dominion', can the boast be derided as arrogant
and vain'? Generation after generation', century after century
had passed away', and still they maintained possession of the
land'. A period had elapsed'. . longer than that which has
passed since England was subjugated by the Norman conquer-
ors'; and the descendants of Musa and Tarik might as little
anticipate being driven into exile across the same straits'. .
traversed by their triumphant ancestors', as the descendants of
Rollo and William', and their victorious peers', may dream of
being driven back to the shores of Normandy':
With all this', however', the Moslem empire in Spain'.. was
but a brilliant exotick that took no permanent root in the soil it
embellished'. Secured from all their neighbours of the west
by impassable barriers of faith and manners', and separated
by seas and deserts from their kindred of the east', they were
an isolated people'. Their whole existence was a prolonged',
thoughgallant', and chivalrick struggle for a foot-holdin a usurped
land'. They were the outposts and frontiers of Islamism'.
The peninsula was the great battle-ground where the Gothick
conquerors of the north', and the Moslem conquerors of a the
east', met and strove fore mastery'; and the fiery courage of
the Arab'. . was at length subdued by the obstinate and perse-
vering valour of the Goth'.

Thoughts on Hand-Writing.–VERPLANCK.
Extract-from Bliss' Talisman, of 1828.
WHEN one has nothing which is actually new or interesting
to say upon a subject', it is a question which very naturally
suggestse itself to the reader', why he writes about it at all ?
I', therefore', suppose this question directed to myself'; and
reply', with perfect honesty', that', in making such remarks as
occur to me on the subject of chirography', I am fulfilling a
promise', and also writing a prefaced to a story which I have
to tell'.
I have had reasons for meditating much on the mystery of
hand-writings', though my reflections have resulted in no new
discoveries'; and I have neither solved any of the paradoxes',
nor come to a definite conclusion on any of the doubtful points
with which the subject is pregnant'. The first difficulty which
was suggested to my mind about it', occurred in early child-
hood'. I could not discover how the rapping of me over the
knuckles with a long', round', lignum-vitæ ruler', until those
articulations were discoloured and lame', was to assist me in
using my fingers with ease and grace', in copying the pithy
scraps of morality which wered set before me'. My master',
however', seemed to think it was good for me'. The poor man

took a world of pains', and gave me a great many', to very
little purpose'.
I certainly never became a proficient in caligraphy'. I have',
however, in the course of my life', been consoled for my own
imperfections on this score', by observing scholars', statesmen',
and gentlemen at large', who passed very well in the world',
and obtained professorships', outfits', and salaries', and the
entréé into polite society', whose signs manual were hieroglyph-
icks', which Champollion himself would give up in despair'.
Their whole manipulation', (as the learned would say',) with
pen', ink', and paper', produced a result so utterly undecipher-
able', that', instead of its painting thought', and speaking to
the eyes',' if their secretaries or correspondents had not known
what they wanted to say', or to have said for them', the
persons
interested in their despatches', might as well have been in the
innocent situation of John Lump and Looney Mactwalter', when
they had “mixed the billy-duxes'.'
I have known lawyers and doctors whose autographick out-
pourings the solicitor and apothecary alone understood by pro-
fessional instinct': and yet', the bills in chancery of the former',
fairly engrossed', produced suits that are nct yet decided'; and
the prescriptions of the latter', found their way into the patient's
system', and caused a great effect'.
There is one thing', however', on which I have made up my
mind decidedly'; which is', that one who writes so detestable a
hand that he cannot read it himself', acts in an improper man.
ner', and abuses the gift which Cadmus was good enough to
introduce into Europe'.
The character of my own writing seems somewhat amended
since time has laid his frosty hand upon my head', and cramped
the joints of my fingers'. It is less capricious in the variety of
directions in which the letters run', and less luxuriant in gratui-
tous additions to their tops and bottoms', and natural termina-
tions'. They look more like a platoon of regular troops', and
less like a militia training'; more like an arrangement produced
by the agency of human intellect', and less like the irregular
scratches made by the brute creation in the surface of the soil:
so that I get along without any material difficulty', and have',
indeed', been sometimes complimented on the elegance of my
writing'.
That the intellectual and moral character of a person may
be ascertained from his hand-writing', is a theorye which many

are fond of believing in'; and', to a certain extent', it
may
be
made to appear plausible'.
The sex of the writer may be conjectured with more infalli-
bility than any other attribute'.

Tapering', yet straight', like pine trees in his grove';

Still', one cannot always tell from the appearance of a manu.
script', whether a lady or a gentleman has held the pen'. I had
a female relative', who was a strong', stout-built woman', to be
sure', but who wrote a hand so formidably masculine', that the
only suiter that ever made her an offer', was terrified out of his
negotiation by the first billet-doux he had the honour of receiv.
ing from her. He was a slender and delicately made man',
and wrote a fine Italian hand'.
Next to the sex', the age of the writer may be guessed at
from the chirography', with most certainty': but some people
write a puerile hand all their lives'. The gravest maxims',
the
profoundest thoughts', the most abstruse reasonings', have some-
times been originally imbodied in signs as fantastical as the
scrawls made in sport by a child'. On the other hand', men of
regular temperament', and methodical habits of business', will
acquire a formed and deliberate character in their hand-writing',
which is often not impaired until extreme age'.
The nation', profession', and other accidental properties of a
person', may also', perhaps', in a majority of instances', be
discovered from his chirograph'. It is obvious', however', that
there is no mystery in this which philosophy needs be invoked
to elucidate'. Mr. Owen's doctrine of circumstances will explain
it very satisfactorily'.
Some. conceited people try to write as badly as they can',
because they have heard', and believe', that it is a proof of
genius'. While all admit', that this notion is altogether absurd',
it is generally conceded that men of genius do write in a very
obscure', infirm', or eccentrick character'; in illustration of
which fact', a thousand instances might be adduced', such as
Byron', and Chalmers', and Jeffrey', and Bonaparte', and so
forth': a goodly assortment in the same lot'! One thing is very
certain', that they who write a great deal for the press', will
soon write very badly': and it is by no means necessary to
ascribe this circumstance to intellectual organization'. Bona-
parte had no time', when dictating to six clerks at once', or

hand'. Distinguished as he was above other men in his fame
and in his fortunes', I believe we may also concede to him the
honour of having written the worst', possible hand', deciphera-
ble by human ingenuity'. And when we find', from the fac-
similes of some of his early despatches', how abominably he
spelled', as well as wrote', we are led to infer', that a defective
education, and an eagle-eyed ambition which soon began

sphere', will sufficiently account for a matter of so small import-
ance to so great a man', without resorting to 'metaphysical aid'
to account for his bad writing'.
But to leave this droughty and prosing disquisition', I am
minded to illustrate both the evils and the advantages of bad or
illegible writing', by incidents which have occurred', or are
easily supposable', in real life'. My poor old master', against
whose memory I cherish no malice', notwithstanding his fre-
quent fustigation of my youthful knuckles', when he despaired
of my profiting', either by the unction of his precepts', or the
sore application of his ruler', endeavoured to frighten me into
amendment by examples'. He composed for my use', a digested
chronicle of casualties which had befallen those who perpetrated
unseemly scrawls'; and after the manner of Swift', entitled his
tract', “God's Revenge against Cacography':” I have long
since lost the precious gift'; but I have not forgotten all the
legends it contained'.
The tale is old of the English gentleman who had procured
for his friend a situation in the service of the East India Com.
pany', and who was put to unprofitable expense by misreading
an epistle', in which the latter endeavoured to express his grati-
tude'. “Having',” said the absentee', “ been thus placed in a
post where I am sure of a regular salary', and where I have it
in my power', while I enjoy health', to lay up something every
year to provide for the future', I am not unmindful of my bene-
factor', and mean soon to send you an equivalent'.”
Such a
villanous hand did this grateful Indian write', that the gentle-
man" thought he meant soon to send him an elephant'. Accord-
ingly', he erected a large outhouse for the unwieldy pet'; but
never got any thing to put into it', except a little pot of sweet-
meats', and an additional bundle of compliments!.
Few who have read the newspapers', have not seen an anec-
dote of an amateur of queer animals', who sent an order to
Africa for two monkeys'. The word two', as he wrote it', so

resembled the figures 100', that his literal and single-minded
agent was somewhat perplexed in executing this commission',
as it compelled him to make war on the whole nation'. And
great was the naturalist's surprise and perplexity, when he re-
ceived a letter', informing him', in mercantile phraseology', that
80 monkeys had been shipped', as per copy of the bill of lading
enclosed', and that his correspondent hoped to be able to execute
the rest of the order in time for the next
Many', too', must have read a story which appeared in the
English newspapers', a few months since', of the distressful
predicament into which a poor fisherman's wife was thrown by
the receipt of a letter from her husband', who had been absent
from home', with several of his brethren', beyond the ordinary
time'. The honest man stated', in piscatorial phrase', the causes
of his detention', and what luck he had met with in his fishing'.
But the conclusion of his bulletin', as spelled by his loving',
amphibious helpmate', was as follows': 'I AM NO MOŘE'! The
poor woman gazed awhile on this fatal', official intelligence of
her husband's demise', and then on her eleven now fatherless
infants'; and then she burst into a paroxysm of clamorous
sorrow', which drew around her the consorts of seventeen other
fishermen who had departed in company with the deceased
man'. None of them could read'; but they caught from the
widow's broken lamentations', the contents of the supernatural
postscript'; and taking it for granted', that they had all been
served in the same manner by the treacherous element', they
all lifted up their voices', and the corners of their aprons', and
made an ululation worthy of so many forsaken mermaids'. In
the words of the poet', they made “’igh water in the sea',"
whose margin they stood'; when one of the overseers of the
poor', who came to the spot', alarmed by the rumour that the
parish was like to be burdened with eighteen new widows', and
a hundred and odd parcel of orphans', snatched the letter from
the weeping Thetis', and silenced the grief of the company', by
making out its conclusion correctly', which was', 'I add no
more'.
There is a memorable passage in our annals', which must be
familiar to those who have read the old chronicles and records
of our early', colonial history'. I allude to the consternation
into which the General Court of the Massachusetts', and their
associated settlements', were thrown', when their clerk read to
them a letter from a worthy divine', purporting', that he address.
ed them', not as magistrates', but as a set of Indian Devils'.

The horrour-stricken official paused in his prelection', aghast
as was the clerk in England'—for whose proper psalm a wag
had substituted • Chevy Chase','—when he came to the words”,
woful hunting'.' He looked at the manuscript again', and
after a thorough examination', exclaimed', “ yea'! it is Indian
Devils'." A burst of indignation from the grave Sanhedrim',
long', loud', and deep', followed this declaration'. They
would all have better brooked to be called by the name of
Baptists', Papists', or any other pestilent hereticks', than to be
branded as the very heathen', whom they had themselves never
scrupled to compliment by calling them children of Beelzebub'.
If I remember aright', the venerable Cotton Mather notes', in
his biographies of the eminent divines of his day', that the
innocent offender was', in this instance', roughly handled by
the secular arm of justice', for insulting the dignitaries both of
church and state', before he had an opportunity of convincing
his brother dignitaries', that the offensive epithet', Indian Devils",
was a pure mistake in their manner of reading his epistle'; in.

Individuals'. The apology was accepted'; though', I observe',
that the latter word is', at present', deemed impolite', if not
actionable', in Kentucky'; and is as provoking to a citizen of
that state', as it was to dame Quickly to be called a woman',
and a thing to thank God on', by Sir John Falstaff'.

eral air of his countenance', notwithstanding something seemed
to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time', agreed to
the account'.
It was one of those heads which Guido has often painted'
mild', pale', penetrating'; free from all common-place ideas of
fat', contented ignorance', looking downwards upon the earth'.
It looked forward'; but looked as if it beheld something be-
yond this world'. How one of his order came by it', heaven
above', who let it fall upon a Monk's shoulders', best knows';
but it would have suited a Bramin'; and had I met it upon the
plains of Hindostan', I had reverenced it'.
The rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes': it
might be put into the hands of any one to design'; for it was
neither elegant', nor otherwise', but as character and expression
made it so'. It was a thin', spare form', somewhat above the
common size', if it lost not the distinction by a bend forward
in the figure'—but this was the attitude of entreaty'; and as it
now stands present to my imagination', it gains more than it
loses by it'.
When he had entered the room three paces', he stood still';
and laying his left hand upon his breast', (a slender', white
staff with which he journeyed', being in his right',) when I had
got close up to him', he introduced himself with the little story
of the wants of his convent', and the poverty of his order'; and
did it with so simple a grace', and such an air of deprecation
was there in the whole cast of his look and figure',—that I must
have been bewitched' .. not to have been struck with it'. A
better reason was', I had predetermined not to give him a single
sous'.
'Tis very true', said I', replying to a cast upwards with his
eyes', with which he had concluded his address'— tis very true';
and Heaven be their resource', who have no other than the
charity of the world'; the stock of which', I fear', is no way
sufficient for the many great claims that are hourly made
As I pronounced the words great claims', he gave a slight
glance with his eyes downwards upon the sleeve of his tunick'.

I'- -a coarse hâbit', and that but once in three years', with a

poor Franciscan made no reply'; a hectick of a moment
passed across his cheek', but it could not tarry'. Nature
seemed to have done with her resentments in him'. He showed
none'; but letting his staff fall within his arm', he pressed both
his hands on his breast with resignation', and retired'.
My heart smote me the moment he shut the door':—Pshaw'!
said I', with an air of carelessness', three several times'. But
it would not do' every ungracious syllable I had uttered',
crowded back upon my imagination'. I reflected that I had no
right over the poor Franciscan but to deny him'; and that the
punishment of that was enough to the disappointed', without
the addition of unkind language'. I considered his gray hairs';
his courteous figure seemed to re-enter', and gently ask me',
what injury he had done me', and why I could use him thus'?

the corporal's lame knee', (which sometimes gave him exquisite
pâin') when my uncle Toby dined or supped alone', he would
never suffer the corporal to stand: and the poor fellow's vene-
ration for his master was such', that', with a proper artillery',
my uncle Toby could have taken Dendermond itself', with less
trouble than he was at to gain this point over him': for many a
time when my uncle Toby supposed the corporal's leg was at
rest', he would look back', and detect him standing behind him',
with the most dutiful respect'. This bred more little squabbles
betwixt them', than all other causes', for five and twenty years
together!
He was one evening sitting thus at his supper', when the
landlord of a little inn in the village' came into the parlour', with
an empty vial in his hand', to beg a glass or two of sack': 'Tis
for a poor gentleman' -I think', of the army', said the land.
lord', who was taken ill at my house four days ago', and has
never held up his head since', or had a desire to taste any thing
till just now', that he had a fancy for a glass of sack', and a
thin toast'. "
“I think'," says he', taking his hand from his
forehead'—" it would comfort me'.”—If I could neither beg',
borrow', nor buy such a thing', added the landlord, I would
almost steal it for the poor gentleman', he is so ill'—I hope he
will still mênd', continued he', --we are all of us concerned
for him'.
Thou art a good-natured soul', I will answer for thee', cried
my uncle Toby'; and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's
health in a glass of sack thyself '-and take a couple of bot-
tles', with my service', and tell him he is heartily welcome to
them', and to a dozen more', if they will do him gôôd'.
Though I am persuaded', said my uncle Toby', as the land-
I
lord shut the door', he is a very compassionate fellow', Trim',
yet I cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his guest too'.
There must be something more than common in him', that', in
so short a time', should win so much upon the affections of his
host'—and of his whole family', added the corporal', for they
are all concerned for him'.-Step after him', said my
uncle
Toby-do', Trim', and ask if he knows his name'.
I have quite forgotten it', truly', said the landlord', coming
back into the parlour with the corporal'; but I can ask his son
again'.-Has he a son with him', then'? said my uncle Toby'.
-A boy', replied the landlord', of about eleven or twelve years
of age'; but the poor creature has tasted almost as little as his
father'. He does nothing but mourn and lament for him night
and day'. He has not stirred from the bed-side these two days'.

My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork', and thrust his
plate from before him', as the landlord gave him the account';
and Trim', without being ordered', took them away', without
saying one word', and in a few minutes after', brought him his
pipe and tobacco'.
Trîm'! said my uncle Toby', I have a project in my head',
as it is a bad night', of wrapping myself up warm in my
roquelaure', and paying a visit to this poor gentleman'.—Your
honour's roquelaure', replied the corporal', has not once been
had on since the night before your honour received your wÔund,
when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St.
Nicholas'; and besides', it is so cold and rainy a night', that',
what with the roquelaure!! and what with the weather'! it will
be enough to give your honour your death'. I fear so', replied
my uncle Toby'; but I am not at rest in my mind', Trim', since
the account the landlord has given me'- I wish I had not known
so much of this affair', added my uncle Toby', or', that I had
known more of it'. How shall we manage it'? Leave it', an't
please your honour', to me', quoth the corporal'. I'll take my
hat and stick', and go to the house', and reconnoitre', and act
accordingly': and I will bring your honour a full account in an
hôûr'. Thou shalt go', Trim', said my uncle Toby'; and here's
a shilling for thee to drink with his servant. I shall get it all
out of him', said the corporal', shutting the door'.
It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the ashes out of
his third pipe', that corporal Trim returned from the inn', and
gave him the following account':-
I despaired', at first', said the corporal', of being able to bring
back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor
sick lieutenant'-Is he of the army', then'? said my uncle
Toby':-He is', said the corporal -And in what regiment?

terrupt thee'. So sit down at thy ease', Trim', in the window
seat', and begin thy story again. The corporal made his old
bow', which generally spoke', as plainly as a bow could speak it',
“ Your honour is good";” and having done that', he sat down',
as he was ordered', and began the story to my uncle Toby over
again', in pretty nearly, the same words'.
I despaired', at first, said the corporal', of being able to bring
back any intelligence to your honour', about the lieutenant and
his son': for when I asked where his servant was', from whom

be asked'—That's a right distinction', Trim', said my uncle
Toby - I was answered', an't please your honour', that he had
no servant with him':-that he had come to the inn with hired
horses'; which', upon finding himself unable to proceed', (to
join the regiment', I suppose',) he had dismissed the morning
after he came'. If I get better', my dear', said he', as he gave
his purse to his son to pay the man', we can hire horses from
hence'. But', alas'! the poor gentleman will never get from
hence', said the landlady to me', for I heard the death-watch all
night long -and when he dies', the youth', his son', will cer.
tainly die with him'; for he is broken-hearted already'.
I was hearing this account', continued the corporal', when the
youth came into the kitchen', to order the thin toast the land-
lord spoke of ;-but I will do it for my father myself', said the
youth'. Pray let me save you the trouble', young gentleman',
said I', taking up a fork for the purpose', and offering him my
chair to sit down upon by the fire', whilst I did it'. I believe',
Sir', said he', very modestly', I can please him best myself ---I
am sure', said I', his honour will not like the toast the worse for
being toasted by an old sôldier'. The youth took hold of my
hand', and instantly burst into tears'. Pôôr yoûth'! said my
uncle Toby'; he has been bred up from an infant in the army',
and the name of a soldier', Trim', sounded in his ears', like the
name of a friend'. I wish I had him here'.
I never', in the longest march', said the corporal', had so
great a mind to my dinner', as I had to cry with him for com-
pany'. What could be the matter with me', an't please your
honour'? Nothing in the world', Trim', said my uncle Toby',
blowing his nose' --but that thou art a good-natured fellow'.
When I gave him the toast', continued the corporal', I thought
it was proper to tell him I was Captain Shandy's servant', and
that your honour', though a stranger', was extremely concerned
for his father'; and that', if there was any thing in your house
or cellar--and thou mightst have added my purse too', said
my uncle Toby')—he was heartily welcome to it. He made a
very low bow', (which was meant to your honour',) but no an.
swer'; for his heart was full'; so he went up stairs with the
toast'. I warrant you', my dear', said I', as I opened the
kitchen door', your father will be well again': Mr. Yorick's
curate was smoking a pipe by the kitchen fire', but said not a
word', good or bad', to comfort the youth'. I thought it
wrong', added the corporal -- I think so too', said my uncle
Toby'.

toast, he felt himself a little revived", and sent down into the
kitchen to let me know', that', in about ten minutes', he should
be glad if I would step up stairs'.-I believe', said the landlord',
he is going to say his prayers', for there was a book laid upon
the chair', by his bed side'; and as I shut the door', I saw his
Ι
son take up a cushion'.
I thought', said the curate', that you gentlemen of the army',
Mr. Trim', never said your prayers at all'. I heard the poor
gentleman say his prayers last night', said the landlady', very
devoutly', and with my own ears', or I could not have believed
it'. Are you sure of it'? replied the curate'. A soldier', an't
please your reverence', said I', prays as often' (of his own ac.
cord') as a parson'; and when he is fighting for his king', and
for his own life', and for his honour too', he has the most reason
to pray to God of any one in the whole world'. 'Twas well
said of thee', Trim', said my uncle Toby', --but when a soldier',
said I', an't please your reverence', has been standing for twelve
hours together in the trenches', up to his knees in cold water',
or engaged', said I', for months together', in long and dangerous
marches': harassed', perhaps', in his rear to-day'; harassing
others to-morrow';-detached here'; countermanded there';-
resting this night out upon his arms —beat up in his sleep the
next' benumbed in his joints'—perhaps without straw in his
tent to kneel on'—he must say his prayers how and when he
can'.-I believe', said I'—for I was piqued', quoth the corporal',
for the reputation of the army'—I believe', an't please your
reverence', said I', that when a soldier gets time to pray', he
prays as heartily as a parson', though not with all his fuss and
hypocrisy':- Thou shouldest not have said thật', Trim', said my
uncle Toby,' for God only knows who is a hypocrite', and who
is not'. At the great and general review of us all', corporal',-
at the day of judgment', (and not till then')-it will be seen
who have done their duties in this world', and who have not';
and we shall be advanced', Trim', accordingly! I hope we
shall', said Trim'.-It is in the scripture', said my uncle Toby';
and I will show it thee to-morrow': In the mean time', we may
depend upon it', Trim', for our comfort', said my uncle Toby',
that God Almighty is so good and just a governour of the world',
that', if we shall have but done our duties in it', it will never be
inquired into', whether we have done them in a red coat or a
black one':-I hope not', said the corporal':--But go on', Trim',

minutes',) he was lying in his bed', with his head raised upon
his hand', his elbow upon the pillow', and a clean white cam-
brick handkerchief beside it'. The youth was just stooping
down to take up the cushion upon which I supposed he had been
kneeling', the book was laid upon the bed', and', as he rose', in
taking up the cushion with one hand', he reached out his other
to take the book away at the same time'. Let it remain there',
my dear', said the Lieutenant'.
He did not offer to speak to me', till I had walked up close
to his bed-side': If you are Captain Shandy's servant', said he',
you must present my thanks to your master', with my little
boy's thanks along with them', for his courtesy to me':--if
he was of Leven’s'—said the Lieutenant'.—I told him your
honour was'—then', said he', I served three campaigns with
him in Flanders', and remember him'; but it is most likely', as
I had not the honour of any acquaintance with him', that he
knows nothing of me'. You will tell him', however', that the
person his good nature has laid under obligations to him', is one

da', whose wiſe was most unfortunately killed with a musket-
shot', as she lay in my arms in my tent'.--I remember the
story', an't please your honour', said I', very well'. Do you
so'? said he', wiping his eyes with his handkerchief'—then well
may I':-In saying this', he drew a little ring out of his
bosom', which seemed tied with a black riband about his neck',
and kissed it twice':-Here', Billy', said he'—the boy flew
across the room to the bed-side', and falling down upon his
knee', took the ring in his hand', and kissed it too', then kissed
his father', and sat down upon the bed and wept'.
I wish', said my uncle Toby', with a deep sigh'- I wish',
Trim', ... I was asleep'.
Your honour', replied the corporal', is too much concerned':
Shall I pour your honour out a glass of sack to your pipe'?
D8', Trim', said my uncle Toby'.
I remember', said my uncle Toby', sighing again', the story
of the ensign and his wife', and particularly well, that he', as
well as she', upon some account or other', (I forget what',) was
universally pitied by the whole regiment'; but finish the story'.
'Tis finished already', said the corporal', for I could stay no
longer', so I wished his honour a good night'. Young Le Fever
rose from off the bed', and saw me to the bottom of the stairs';

Ireland', and were on their route to join the regiment in Flan-
ders'. But', alas'! said the corporal', the Lieutenant's last day's
march is över'. Then what is to become of his poor boy?
cried my uncle Toby'.
Thou hast left this matter short', said my uncle Toby to the
corporal', as he was putting him to bed', and I will tell thee in
whât', Trim'. In the first place', when thou madest an offer of
my services to Le Fever', as sickness and travelling are both
expensive', and thou knewest he was but a poor Lieutenant',
with a son to subsist', as well as himself', out of his pay', that
thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse'; because',
had he stood in need', thou knowest', Trim', he had been as
welcome to it as myself'. Your honour knows', said the cor-
poral', I had no ôrders'. Trûe', quoth my uncle Toby'; thou
didst very right', Trim', as a SÔLDIER', but', certainly', very
wrong', as a Man'.
In the second place', for which', indeed', thou hast the same
excuse', continued my uncle Toby', when thou offeredst him
whatever was in my house', thou shouldst have offered him my
house tôô'. A sick brother officer'.. should have the best quar.
ters', Trim'; and if we had him with us', we could tend and
look to him'. Thou art an excellent nurse thyself', Trim'; and
what with thy care of him', and the old woman's', and his
boy's', and mine together', we might recruit him again at once',
and set him upon his legs'.
In a fortnight or three weeks', added my uncle Toby',
smiling', he might march'. He will never march', an't please
your honour', in this world', said the corporal'. He will march',
said my uncle Toby', rising up from the side of the bed', with
one shoe off". An't please your honour', said the corporal', he.
will never march'.. but to his grâve'. He SHALL march', cried
my uncle Toby', marching the foot which had a shoe on',
though without advancing an inch': he shall march to his regi.
ment'. He cannot stand it', said the corporal'. He shall be
supported', said my uncle Toby'. He'll drop at last', said the
corporal', and what will become of his boy? He shall not
drop', said my uncle Toby', firmly'. A well o'day! do what
we can for him', said Trim', maintaining his point': the poor
soul will die'. He shall NOT die', by Hn', cried my uncle
Toby'.

with the oath', blushed as he gave it in'; and the Recording
Angel', as he wrote it down', dropped a tear upon the word',

STORY OF LE FEVER.

My uncle Toby went to his bureau', put his purse into his
pocket', and having ordered the corporal to go early in the
morning for a physician', he went to bed and fell asleep'.
The sun looked bright the morning after', to every eye in the
village but Le Fever's and his afflicted son’s'; the hand of death
pressed heavy upon his eyelids', and hardly could the wheel at
the cistern turn round its circle', when my uncle Toby', who
had got up an hour before his wonted time', entered the Lieu.
tenant's room', and', without preface or apology', sat himself
down upon the chair by the bed-side'; and independent of all
modes and customs', opened the curtain', in the manner an old
friend and brother officer would have done it', and asked him
how he did'—how he had rested in the night'-what was his
complaint' —where was his pain-and what he could do to
help him'? And without giving him time to answer any one
of these inquiries', went on and told him of the little plan which
he had been concerting for him', with the corporal', the night
before'.
You shall go home directly', Le Fever', said my uncle Toby',
to my house -and we'll send for a doctor to see what's the
matter and we'll have an apothecary'—and the corporal
shall be your nurse', and I'll be your servant', Le Fever'.
There was a frankness in my uncle Toby'-not the effect
of familiarity', but the cause of it'—which let you at once into
his soul', and showed you the goodness of his nature': to this',
there was something in his looks', and voice', and manner',
superadded', which always beckoned to the unfortunate to come
and take shelter under him'; so that before my uncle Toby had
half finished the kind offers he was making to the father', the
son had insensibly pressed up close to his knees', and had taken
hold of the breast of his coat', and was pulling it towards him'.
The blood and spirit of Le Fever', which were waxing cold and
slow within him', and were retreating to their last citadel', the
heart', rallied back'—the film forsook his eyes for a moment'
he looked up wistfully in my uncle Toby's face then cast a
look upon his boy':
Nature instantly ebbed again the film returned to its place
-the pulse fluttered'-stopped went on—throbbed'-stopped
again -moved'--stopped-shall I go on'?—No'.

SECTION VI.
Advantages of a Civilized, over a Savage, State.-SPURZHEIM.
It has been asked', whether intelligence or ignorance is the
more conducive to happiness. A few observations will prove',
that education is highly calculated to promote civilization'; and',
also', where well conducted', to improve both the body and the
mind'. What a difference do we perceive in the conduct of va-
rious nations', by observing them through the different periods
of their improvement'! The history of every nation in its bar-
barous state', is sullied with accounts of assassinations', par-
ricides', incest', and violation of the most sacred oaths'. The
selfish passions appear then to wield an overwhelming power';
and all enjoyments spring from the gratification of the lower
propensities
In periods of ignorance', too', every nation confines moral
virtue to itself', and considers the rest of mankind as destined to
be its prey'Legislation', corresponding with the national
character', is sanguinary, and capital punishment', frequent,
Nay, it falls not on criminals alone', but', also', on their rela-
tives, and on whole districts'. Their religion is founded in
terrour'; their gods are endowed with all the lower feelings
and affections, such as selfishness', jealousy', anger', and fond-
ness of extravagant actions and expiatory sacrifices'If they
hope for immortality', the scenes of happiness which they ex-
pect', are conformable to their actual feelings'; such as tri.
umphing over their enemies, and the gratification of low pas-
sions and sensual pleasures. Their leading tendency of mind',
is atrocity'; and most of their actions', are but a series of hor-
rid crimes.
I doubt whether they who consider the savage state so
worthy of commendation", would be disposed to give up the
comforts of civilization', and be satisfied with the food', cloth-
ing', habitations', and accommodations of barbarians';-whether
they would prefer nuts', acorns", roots', insects', and other loath-
some animals', to the preparations of a skilful cookery ;--
whether they would be better pleased with clothes made of the
skins of animals, of leaves, or of grass”, than with woollen,
cotton', 'linen', or silk habiliments'; — whether they would like to
exchange our comfortable rooms for a hollow tree', the cavity of
a rock', a den under ground', or a hut of reeds', or of turf and
branches of trees';-whether', in short', they would seriously
think the rough attempts of savages at painting and sculpture',
equal to the statues of Phidias', and the paintings of Raphael".

CHRISTIANITY AND PAGANISM.
In tracing the history of mankind', it may be observed', that',
in proportion as nations cultivate their moral and intellectual
powers', brutal actions and atrocious crimes are diminished
both in number and quality', the manners and pleasures become
refined', legislation', milder', religion', purified and freed from
superstition', and that science and the arts address themselves to
the finer emotions and affections of the mind'.

SECTION VII.
Superiority of Christianily over Paganism.-IB.
Savages'.. commonly believe in polytheism', and consider all
superiour beings'..as malevolent', and worship them through
fear. People in a more cultivated state', admit of superiour
beings of a mixed nature, like men. The gods of the Greeks',
for example', were supposed to be endowed with human pas-
sions and feelings. They required food', drink', and sleep,
Even Jupiter', the greatest of all, was subject to the frailties of
human nature': he was often jealous', artful', cruel', and impla-
cable'. He had overturned every thing in heaven', and com-
pelled the other gods to be his slaves'.
The gods of the Romans', were no less ignoble. They were
selfish and mercenary':—could be bribed with fine temples,
games', and sacrifices?
Nations a little advanced in learning', have divided invisible
beings into benevolent and malevolent. Others have admitted
two general principles', the one', benevolent', the other', inalev-
olent"; and have also acknowledged many inferiour deities', as
emanations from the primitive ones':
Those', again', of more cultivated minds', believe in one su-
preme, benevolent Deity'; and', likewise', in inferiour spirits",
some benevolent', others malevolent'. But the most enlighten-
ed'.. acknowledge only one Supreme Being, infinite in wisdom
and perfection', and the Creator of all things
Modes of worship .. deserve', also', particular consideration
in the history of man'. These'.. are always conformable to
the notions entertained of the nature and character of the deity
adored'. In order to avert the wrath of the malevolent powers',
and to please them', men have made themselves as miserable as
possible-by mortifications, by flagellations'
, by painful exer-
tions and severe labours, by the offering up of sacred victims
and human sacrifices', and even by suicides? To gain the fa-
vour of manlike gods', sweet-smelling herbs', burning incense',

oblations', and gifts', agreeable impressions on the senses', cer-
emonies which illustrate a prince at court', and various other
formalities', have been employed.
If we compare the absurdities of paganism', or even the bet-
ter doctrines of Judaism', with the pure and sublime principles
of Christianity', we cannot but perceive,' that the last-mention-
ed'.. are vastly superiour. The Jewish dispensation', indeed',
may be viewed as accommodated', in some good degree', to the
peculiar condition of the Jews', who were a hard-hearted', stiff-
necked', stubborn race'; but', when contrasted with paganism',
how generous and noble do the principles of Christianity ap-
pear'! They prohibit anger', hatred', and revenge'; and en-
join upon us not to return evil for evil'. They command for-
giveness of every offence'.. seven times in a day, and', if asked
for', seventy times seven'. They require us to love our enemies',
to bless them that curse us', and to do good to them that hate
us: They interdict all selfish passions', and declare every one
to be our neighbour'.
The New Covenant was made for the whole of mankind'.
Our Saviour asked drink of a woman of Samaria', when the
Jews had no dealings with her nation'. He associated with
Jews and Gentiles'; ate with publicans and sinners'; and de-
clared him', only', who did the will of his heavenly Father', to
be his mother', his sister', or brother'.
Before the Christian dispensation', empires were founded by
the sword', and by the most cruel and frightful destruction of
the vanquished'. Christ declared that he came', not to destroy
men's lives', but to save them';—that he who exalteth himself,
shall be abased'. He was no respecter of persons', and consid-
ered love and peace'.. as the grand sum of all the command-
ments'. He proposed'...the doctrines of his heavenly Father
for the acceptance of mankind', but did not enforce it by the
sword'. He directed his disciples only to shake off the dust of
their feet in departing out of that house or that city in which
they had been uncourteously received', or in which their words
had not been attended to:
The superiority of the Christian principles over the Jervish
law', is well known'. St. Paul'.. said to the Hebrews', that
“Christ.. is more worthy than Moses';" and', “By so much
is Christ made a surety of a better Testamentº:" and', again',
" If the first Covenant. . had been faultless', then would no
place have been found for the second"." True Christianity':
improves the moral and religious character'.. of a Jew', and is
capable of converting'.. a philosopher'.

WISDOM AND MAJESTY OF GOD.
Since the Christian rules have been established', the follow
ers of Christianity'.. have often fallen back into many of the
pitiful doctrines of the heathen'. Many important points':-
have been neglected", and trifles', attended to'. But', notwith-
standing all these abuses', it is certain that the precepts of moral
and religious conduct', have been greatly improved'.. by Chris-
tianity'. Many selfish and absurd notions'. . have been rectified';
and', as human nature becomes better understood', the pure and
exalted precepts of our Christian religion', will continue more
and more to shed their benign influence over the human race.
True Christianity'.. will gain ground'.. by every step which
is made in the knowledge of man'.

SECTION VIII.
The Wisdom and Majesty of God, attested by the Works of
Creation.-DR. CHALMERS.
It is truly a Christian exercise'.. to extract a sentiment of piety from
the works and the appearances of nature'. It has the authority of the
Sacred Writers upon its side', and even our Saviour himself"..gives
it the weight and the solemnity of his example'. “Behold the lilies of
the field': they toil nol', neither do they spin'; yet your heavenly Fa-
ther careth for them" He expatiates on the beauty of a single flower',
and draws from it the delightful argument of confidence in God'. He
gives us to see', that taste may be combined with piety, and that the
same heart may be occupied with all that is serious in the contempla-
tions of religion', and', at the same time', be alive to the charms and
the loveliness of nature.
The Psalmist takes a still loftier flight'. He leaves the world', and
lifts his imagination to that mighty expanse which spreads above it and
around it'. He wings his way through space', and wanders in thought
over its immeasurable regions'. Instead of a dark and unpeopled soli-
tude', he sees it crowded with splendour', and filled with the energy of
the Divine Presence Creation rises in its immensily before him', and
the world', with all it inherits', shrinks into littleness at a contempla-
tion so vast and so overpowering! He wonders that he is not over-
looked amid the grandeur and the variety which are on every side of
him'; and', passing upward from the majesty of nature'.. to the majesty
of nature's Architect', he exclaims', " What is man'..that thou art mind-
ful of him', or the son of man'..that thou shouldst deign to visit him'?"
It is not for us to say', whether inspiration revealed to the Psalmist
the wonders of the modern astronomyBut even admitting the mind
to be a perfect stranger to the science of these enlightened times', the
heavens present to it a great and an elevating spectacle', an immense
concave', reposing upon the circular boundary of the world', and the
innumerable lights which are suspended from on high', moving with
solemn regularity along its surface'.
It seems to have been at night', when the moon and the stars were
visible', and not when the sun had risen in his strength', and thrown a
splendour around him', which bore down and eclipsed all the minor
glories of the firmament, that the piety of the Psalmist was awakened

by this contemplation. And there is much in the scenery of a nocturnal
sky' .. to liſt the soul to pious contemplation'. That moon', and those
stars', what are they'? They are detached from the world', and they
lift you above it. You feel withdrawn from the earth', and rise in
lofty abstraction above this little theatre of human passions and human
anxieties'. The mind abandons itself to revery', and is transferred', in
the ecstasy of its thoughts', to distant and unexplored regions'. It sees
nature in the simplicity of its great elements, and it sees the God of
nature invested with the high attributes of wisdom and majesty':

Astral Worlds are Inhabited.-IB.
The heavenly bodies appear small to an inhabitant of this earth', only
on account of the immensity of their distance from it'. When we talk
of hundreds of millions of miles', it is not to be listened to as incredible';
for we should remember'.. that we are talking of those bodies which
are scattered over the immensity of space', and that space knows no
limit'. The conception is great and difficult“, but the truth'.. is unques-
tionable'. By a process of measurement', which it is unnecessary at
present to explain', we have ascertained', first, the distance', and then',
the magnitude', of some of those bodies which roll in the firmament';
that the sun', which presents itself to the eye under so diminutive a
form', is really a globe', exceeding', by many thousands of times', the
dimensions of the earth which we inhabit'; that the moon itself has the
magnitude of a world'; and that even a few of those stars', which ap-
pear like so many lucid points to the unassisted eye of the observer',
expand into large circles upon the application of the telescope', and are',
some of them', much larger than the hall which we tread upon', and to
which we proudly apply the demonstration of the universe'.
Now', what is the fair and obvious presumption'? The world in
which we live', is a round ball of a determined magnitude', and occu-
pies its own place in the firmament. But when we explore the unlim-
ited tracts of that space which is everywhere around us', we meet with
other balls of equal', or superiour', magnitude', and from which our
earth would either be invisible', or appear as small as any of thoso
twinkling stars which are seen on the canopy of heaven' Why', then',
suppose' .. that this little spot'— little', at least', in the immensity which
surrounds it'should be the exclusive abode of life and of intelligence ?
What reason have we to think' .. that those mightier globes which roll
in other parts of creation', and which we have discovered to be worlds
in magnitude', are not also worlds in use and in dignity' ? Why should
we think'.. that the great Architect of nature', supreme in wisdom', as
he is in power', would call these stately mansions into existence', and
leave them unoccupied'?
When we cast our eye over the broad sea', and look at the country
on the other side', we see nothing but the blue land' .. stretching ob-
scurely over the distant horizon'. We are too far away to perceive the
richness of its scenery', or to hear the sound of its population'. Why
not extend this principle to the still more distant parts of the universe ?
What though', from this remote point of observation', we can see nothing
but the naked 'roundness of yon planetary orbs"? Are we', therefore', to
say', that they are so many vast and unpeopled solitudes' that desola-

tion reigns in every part of the universe but ours'? that the whole
energy of the divine attributes', is expended on one insignificant
corner' .. of these mighty works'? and that', to this earth alone belongs
the bloom of vegetation, or the blessedness of life'; or the dignity of
rational and immortal existence' ?
But this is not all. We have something more than the mere magni-
tude of the planets to allege in favour of the idea that they are inhabited'.
We know ihat this earth turns round upon itself'; and we observe' .
that all those celestial bodies which are accessible to such an observa-
tion', have the same movement'. We know that the earth performs a
yearly revolution round the sun'; and we can detect', in all the planets
which composé our system', a revolution of the same kind', and under
similar circumstances'. They have the same succession of day and
night'. They have the same agreeable vicissitude of the seasons. To
them' .. light and darkness succeed each other'; and the gayety of
summer is followed by the dreariness of winter'. To each of them'.
the heavens present as våried and magnificent a spectacle'; and this
earth’, the encompassing of which', would require the labour of years
from one of its puny inhabitants', is but one of the smaller lights which
sparkle in their firmament'.
To them', as well as to us', has God divided the light from the dark-
ness'; and he has called the light' .. day, and the darkness'. . he has
called night'. He has said', "Let there be lights in the firmament of
their heaven', to divide the day from the night': and let them be for
signs', and for seasons', and for days', and for years': and let them be
for lights in the firmament of heaven', to give light upon their earth';
and it was so." And God has also made to them' .. great lights'. To
all of them' .. he has given the sun to rule the day'; and, to many of
them' .. has he given moons to rule the night'. To them he has made
the stars also'. And God has set them in the firmament of heaven', to
give light unto their earth', and to rule over the day', and over the
night', and to divide the light from the darkness'; and God has seen
that it was good'.
In all these greater arrangements of divine wisdoin', we can see that
God has done ihe same things for the accommodation of the planets',
that he has done for the earth which we inhabit'. And shall we say’,
that the resemblance stops here', because we are not in a situation to
observe it'? Shall we say', that this scene of magnificence' .. has been
called into being', merely for the amusement of a few astronomers'?
Shall we measure the counsels of heaven by the narrow importance of
the human faculties'? or shall we conceive”, that silence and solitude
reign throughout the mighty empire of nature'? that the greater part
of creation is an empty parade'? and that not a worshipper of the
Divinity is to be found through the wide extent of yon vast and im-
measurable regions'?
It lends a delightful confirmation to the argument', when', from the
growing perfection of our instruments', we can discover a new point of
resemblance between our earth and the other bodies of the planetary
system: It is now ascertained', not merely that all of them have their
day and night', and their vicissitudes of seasons', and that some of them
have their moons to rule their night, and alleviate the darkness of it';
but we can see of one', that its surface rises into inequalities', that it
swells into mountains and stretches into valleys"; of another', that it is
surrounded by an atmosphere which may support the respiration of
animals'; of a third', thật clouds are formed and suspended over it',

which may minister to it all the bloom and luxuriance of vegetation';
and of a fourth', that', as its winter advances', a white colour spreads
over its northern regions', and that', on the approach of summer', this
whiteness is dissipated-giving room to suppose', that the element of
water abounds in it', that it rises by evaporation into its atmosphere',
that it freezes upon the application of cold', that it is precipitated in the
form of snow', which covers the ground with its fleecy mantle', and
melts away from the heat of a more vertical sun'; and that other
worlds bear a resemblance to our own', in the same yearly round of
beneficent and interesting changes'.

Shall we say', then', of these vast luminaries', that they were created
in vain ? Were they called into existence for no other purpose than
to throw a tide of useless splendour over the solitudes of immensity'?
Our sun is only one of these luminaries', and we know that he has
worlds in his train'. Why should we strip the rest of this princely at-
tendance'? Why may not each of them be the centre of his own
system', and give light to his own worlds'? It is true', that we have seen
them not'; but', could the eye of man take its flight into those distant
regions', it would lose sight of our little world before it had reached the
outer limits of our system'; the greater planets would disappear in
their turn':-before it had described a small portion of that abyss which
separates us from the fixed stars', the sun would decline into a little
spot, and all its splendid retinue of worlds', would be lost in the obscu-
rity of distance'; -he would', at last', shrink into a small', indivisible
atom', and all that could be seen of this magnificent system', would be
reduced to the glimmering of a little star,
Why resist', any longer’, the grand and interesting conclusion'? Each
of these stars may be the token of a system as vast and as splendid as
the one which we inhabit'. Worlds roll in these distant regions'; and
these worlds must be the mansions of life and intelligence'. In yon
gilded canopy of heaven', we see the broad aspect of the universe,
where each shining point presents us with a sun', and each sun', with
a system of worlds" ;-where the Divinity reigns in all the grandeur of
his attributes";—where he peoples immensity with his wonders', and',
in the greatness of his strength', travels through the dominions of one
vast and unlimited monarchy:
The contemplation has no limits'. If we ask for the number of suns
and of systems, the unassisted eye of man can take in a thousand', and
the best telescope', eighty millions'. But fancy can take its flight far be-
yond the ken of eye or of telescope'. Shall we have the boldness to
say', that there is nothing there'?—that the wonders of the Almighty
are at an end' ?- that the creative energy of God has sunk into repose,
because the imagination is enfeebled by the magnitude of its efforts'?
To an eye that could spread itself over the whole system of worlds',
the mansion which accommodates our species', might be so very small
as to lie wrapped up in microscopical concealment'. What is seen',
may be nothing to what is unseen'; for what is seen', is limited by the
range of our instruments'. What is unseen', has no limit; and', though

were swept away', there might still remain a more ample field over
which the Divinity may expatiate', and which he may have peopled
with innumerable worlds'
If the whole visible creation were to disappear', it would leave a
solitude behind it'; but to the infinite Mind', that can take in the whole
system of nature', this solitude might be nothing -a small', unoccupied
point in that immensity which surrounds it', and which he may have
filled with the wonders of his omnipotence'. Though this earth were to
be burnt up, though the trumpet of its dissolution were sounded', though
yon sky were to pass away as a scroll', and every visible glory which
the finger of the Divinity has inscribed upon it', were to be put out for
ever'-an event so awful to us, and to every world in our vicinity', by
which so many suns would be extinguished", and so many varied scenes
of life and of population would rush into forgetfulness'-—what is it in
the high scale of the Almighty's workmanship"? a mere shred', which',
though scattered into nothing', would leave the universe of God one
entire scene of greatness and of majesty'.
Though this earth and these heavens were to disappear', there are
other worlds which roll afar'; the light of other suns', shines upon them';
and the sky which mantles them', is garnished with other stars'. Is it
presumption to say', that the moral world extends to these distant and
unknown regions'? that they are occupied with people' ? that the chari-
ties of home and of neighbourhood flourish there'? that the praises of
God are there lifted up', and his goodness rejoiced in'? that piety has its
temples and its offerings'? and that the richness of the divine attribute',
is there felt and admired by intelligent worshippers'?
And what is this world in the immensity which teems with them?
and what are they who occupy it'? The universe at large', would
suffer as little in its splendour and variety by the destruction of our
planet', as the verdure and sublime magnitude of a forest', would suffer
by the fall of a single leaf : The leaf' .. quivers on the branch
which supports it'. It lies at the mercy of the slightest accident'. A
breath of wind' .. tears it from its stem', and it lights on the stream of
water which passes underneath'. In a moment of time', the life which
we know by the microscope', it teems with', is extinguished'; and', an
occurrence so insignificant in the eye of man and on the scale of his
observation', carries in it', to the myriads which people this little leaf',
an event as terrible and as decisive as the destruction of a world's
Now', on the grand scale of the universe', we', the occupiers of this
little ball', which performs its little round among the suns and the sys-
tems that astronomy has unfolded', we may feel the same littleness',
and the same insecurity! We differ from the leaf', only in this cir-
cumstance', that it would require the operation of greater elements to
destroy us. But these elements exist'.' The fire which rages within',
may lift its devouring energy to the surface of our planet', and trans-
form it into one wide and wasting volcano'. The sudden formation of
elastick matter in the bowels of the earth'--and it lies within the agency
of known substances to accomplish this'-may explode it into frag-
ments'. The exhalation of noxious air from below', may impart a
virulence to the air that is around us'; it may affect the delicate propor-
tion of its ingredients'; and the whole of animated nature may
wither and die under the malignity of a tainted atmosphere'. A
blazing comet may cross this fated planet in its orbit', and realize to it
all the terrours which superstition has conceived of it':
These are changes which may happen in a single instant of time,

and against which nothing known in the present system of things',
provides us with any security. They might not annihilate the earth,
but they would unpeople it'; and we', who tread its surface with such
firm and assured footsteps', are at the mercy of devouring elements,
which', if let loose upon us by the hand of the Almighty', would spread
solitude', and silence', and death, over the dominions of the world'.
Now', it is this littleness', and this insecurity, which make the protec-
tion of the Almighty so dear to us, and which bring', with such em-
phasis', to every pious bosom', the holy lessons of humility and grati-
iude'. The God who sitteth above', and who presides in high authority
over all worlds', is mindful of man; and', though at this moment his
energy is felt in the remotest provinces of creation', we may feel the
same security in his providence', as if we were the objects of his un-
divided care'.
It is not for us to bring our minds up to this mysterious agency'.
But', such is the incomprehensible fact", that the same Being', whose eye
is abroad over the whole universe', gives vegetation to every blade of
grass', and motion to every particle of blood which circulates through
the veins of the minutest animal'; that', though his mind takes into its
comprehensive grasp', immensity and all its wonders', I am as much
known to him', as if I were the single object of his attention'; that he
marks all my thoughts"; that he gives birth to every feeling and every
movement within me'; and that', with an xercise of power which I
can neither describe nor comprehend', the same God who sits in the
highest heaven', and reigns over the glories of the firmament', is at my
right hand, to give every breath which I draw', and every comfort
which I enjoy.

To villain-bonds and despot-sway'.
SECTION XIII.
The Passions.COLLINS.
When Musick', heavenly maid', was young',
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft', to hear her shell',
Thronged around her magick cell'
Exulting, trembling', raging', fainting,
Possessed beyond the muse's painting ;
By turns they felt the glowing mind
Disturbed', delighted', raised', refined';
Till once', 'tis said', when all were fired',
Filled with fury', rapt', inspired',
From the supporting myrtles round',
They snatched her instruments of soundº;
And', as they oft had heard apart
Sweet lessons of her forceful art',
Each' (for madness ruled the hour').
Would prove his own expressive power'.
First, Fear', his hand, its skill to try',
Amid the chords bewildered laid',
And back recoiled', he knew not why',
E'en at the sound' himself had made!!

Next', Anger rushed'; his eyes on fire',
In lightnings owned his secret stings”;
In one rude clash he struck the lyre',
And swept', with hurried hand', the strings!
With woful measures wan Despair',
Low', sullen sounds his grief beguiled";
A solemn', strange', and mingled air';
'Twas sad by fits', by starts 'twas wild'.
But thou', O Hope', with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure' ?
Still it whispered promised pleasure',
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!!
Still would her touch the strain prolong';
And', from the rocks', the woods', the vale',
She called on 'echo still’, through all the song';
And', where her sweetest theme she chose,
A soft', responsive voice was heard at every close";
And Hope enchanted smiled', and waved her golden hair'.
And longer had she sung';-but', with a frown',
Revenge impatient rose :
He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down',
And', with a withering look',
The war-denouncing trumpet took',
And blew a blast so loud and dread',
Were ne'er prophetick sounds so full of wo':
And ever and anon, he beat'
The doubling drum, with furious heat';
And though', sometimes', each dreary pause between',
Dejected Pity', at his side',
Her soul-subduing voice applied',
Yet still he kept his wild', unaltered mien',
While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head,
Thy numbers', Jealousy', 10 naught were fixed',
Sad proof of thy distressful state':
Of differing themes the veering song was mixed;
And now it courted Love', now', raving', called on Hate'.
With eyes upraised', as one inspired',
Pale Melancholy sat retired';
And from her wild', sequestered seat',
In notes by distance made more sweet',
Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul';
And', dashing soft from rocks around',
Bubbling runnels joined the sound';
Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole';
Or', o'er some haunted stream', with fond delay',
Round a holy calm diffusing's
Love of peace', and lonely musing',
In hollow murmurs died away'.
But', O'! how altered was its sprightlier tone',
When Cheerfulness', a nymph of healthiest hue',
Her bow across her shoulder flung',
Her buskins gemmed with morning dew',
Blew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung,
The hunter's call\, to faun and dryad known

ALEXANDER'S FEAST.
>
The oak-crowned sisters', and their chaste-eyed queen',
Satyrs and sylvan boys were seen',
Peeping from forth their alleys green':
Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear;
And Sport leaped up', and seized his beechen spear'.
Last came Joy's ecstatick trial':
He', with viny crown advancing,
First to the lively pipe his hand addressed':
But soon he saw the brisk', awakening viol',
Whose sweet', entrancing voice he loved the best' :
They would have thought, who heard the strain',
They saw in Tempe's vale her native maids',
Amidst the festal', sounding shades',
To some unwearied minstrel dancing',
While', as his flying fingers kissed the strings',
Love framed with Mirth', a gay', fantastick round" :
Loose were her tresses seen', her zone unbound';
And he', amidst his frolick play',.
As if he would the charming air repay',
Shook thousand odours from his dewy wings'.

Alexander's Feast; or, The Power of Musick.
AN ODE FOR ST. CECILIA'S DAY.--DRYDEN,
'Twas at the royal feast', for Persia'.. won'
By Philip's warlike son':-
Aloft' .. in awful state',
The godlike hero sat.
On his imperial throne'.
His valiant peers' . . were placed around',
Their brows'. . with roses and with myrtles bound':
So should desert in arms be crowned'.
The lovely Thais' .. by his side
Sat', like a blooming', eastern bride',
In flower of youth and beauty's pride
Happy', happy', happy' .. pair'!
None but the brave,
Nons but the brave,
None but .. the brave', deserve' .. the fair.
Timotheus' .. placed on high’,
Amid the tuneful choir',
With flying fingers touched the lyre :
The trembling notes' .. ascend the sky',
And heavenly joys inspire'.
The song began from Jove,
Who left his blissful seats above';
(Such is the power of mighty love!)
A dragon's fiery form'. . belied the god':
Sublime' .. on radiant spheres he rode',
When he to fair Olympia'.. pressed',
And stamped an image of himself', a sovereign of the world'.
The list'ning crowd'.. admire the lofty sound';
A present deity', they shout around";

A present deity, the vaulted roofs' .. rebound'.
With ravished ears' .. the monarch hears';
Assumes the god'; affects to nod';
And seems to shake the spheres'.
The praise of Bacchus', then', the sweet musician sung';
Of Bacchus', ever fair' .. and ever young
The jolly god in triumph comes' !
Sound the trumpet'; beat the drums';
Flushed with a purple grace',
He shows his honest face';
Now give the hautboys breath-he comes'! he comes'!
Bacchus', ever fair and ever young',
Drinking joys' .. did first ordain':
Bacchus' blessings' .. are a treasure';
Drinking' .. is the soldier's pleasure':
Rich' .. the treasure' ;
Sweet .. the pleasure :
Sweet'.. is pleasure' .. after pain'.
Soothed with the sound', the king grew vain';
Fought all his battles o'er again";
And thrice he routed all his foes', and thrice he slew the slain'.
The master saw the madness rise';
His glowing cheeks', his ardent eyes;
And', while he heaven and earth defied',
Changed his hand', and checked his pride'.
He chose a mournful muse',
Soft pity to infuse':
He sung Darius', great and good',
By too severe a fate',
Fallen', fallen', fallen', fallen',
Fallen' .. from his high estate',
And welt'ring in his blood" :
Deserted at his utmost need
By those his former bounty fed',
On the bare earth'.. exposed he lies',
With not a friend' .. to close his eyes.
With downcast look' .. the joyless victor sar,
Revolving in his altered soul',
The various turns of fate below';
And now and then', a sigh he stole',
And tears' .. began to flow'.
The mighty master .. smiled to see
That love was in the next degree;
'Twas but a kindred sound to move',
For pity'. , melts the mind to love'.
Softly sweet', in Lydian measures',
Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures';
War', he sung', is toil and trouble';
Honour', but an empty bubble!!
Never ending', still beginning;
Fighting still', and still destroying:
If the world be worth thy winning,
Think', O'! think it worth enjoying :

ALEXANDER'S FEAST.
Lovely Thais' . . sits beside thee';
Take the good'.. the gods provide thee':
The many' rend the skies with loud applause';
So', love'. was crowned'; but musick'.. won the cause',
The prince', unable to conceal his pain',
Gazed on the fair
Who caused his care';
And sighed', and looked'; sighed', and looked';
Sighed, and looked'; and sighed again':
At length', with love and wine at once oppressed',
The vanquished victor'.. sunk upon her breast'.
Now strike the golden lyre again';
A louder yet', and yet a louder strain':
Break his bands of sleep asunder',
And rouse him', like a rattling peal of thunder'.
Hark'! hark! the horrid sound'
Has raised up his head',
As awaked from the dead';
And', amazed', he stares around'.
Revenge'! revenge'! Timotheus cries':
See the furies arise';
See the snakes that they rear',
How they hiss in their hair',
And the sparkles that flash from their eyes' !
Behold a ghastly band',
Each a torch in his hand'!
These are Grecian ghosts'.. that in battle were slain',
And', unburied', remain'
Inglorious on the plain'.
Give the vengeance'.. due to the valiant crew'.
Behold! how they toss their torches on high'!
How they point to the Persian abodes',
And glittering temples of their hostile gods !
The princes applaud with a furious joy',
And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy'.
Thais' ... led the way',
To light him to his prey';
And', like another Helen', fired another Troy'.
Thus', long ago',
Ere heaving bellows'.. learned to blow',
While organs yet were mute',
Timotheus', with his breathing flute'
And sounding lyre',
Could swell the soul to rage', or kindle soft desire'.
At last' .. divine Cecilia came',
Inventress of the vocal frame'.
The sweet enthusiasts', from her sacred store'
Enlarged the former narrow bounds',
And added length to solemn sounds',
With nature's mother wit', and arts unknown before'.
Let old Timotheus' .. yield the prize',
Or both divide the crown':
He .. raised a mortal to the skies
She' .. drew an angel' .. down.
THE END.
