PREFACE.
The study of Elocution and Oratory was pursued to a very
high degree by the ancients, and is therefore an old study.
It was, however, so nearly lost as a distinctive branch of cul-
ture, and it received so little attention for many succeeding
centuries that it may be very justly termed a modern science.
It was the original design of the author to prepare for the
use of the National School of Elocution and Oratory, an
outline of principles embodying his system of instruction,
and to furnish the students of the institution a text for their
future personal or public work. The rapidly increasing de-
mand, however, for a more extended exposition of these
principles, and for a copious collection of appropriate exer-
cises, together with the urgent request of many students
and educators throughout the country, has led to the pub-
lication of "Practical Elocution."
Now that the work has been completed, and is about to go
forth on its mission, we are led to realize more deeply than
ever how little of the spirit can go along with the letter-how
little of the inspiration which the true teacher should impart,
can accompany the monotonous lines of the printed page.
We do not believe any theory can substitute for the living

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
presence of the teacher. The theory of Elocution can no
more produce good readers and speakers than the theory of
music will make good singers or experts on the instrument;
yet correct principles may so direct the student away from
error, and towards the truth, and may furnish to the teacher
such resources in methods and exercises as would require
years of time to arrange for himself.
Elocution will not substitute for intellect; neither will it
furnish material for the mind any more than gold will buy
material. It will not provide thought. It will not even pro-
vide vehicles or words, so necessary to the discussion and
exchange of thought. Its work is to give principles and
direction for the management of thought after it has been
furnished and clothed. Knowledge is capital, only valuable
as it is available, and Elocution is the great natural means
of rendering knowledge available.
Spoken language may be said to bear three distinct relations to
the signification of the words which enter into it.
First.-A sentiment may be so uttered as to weaken or
pervert the simple meaning of the words. Wanting in the
necessary force, emphasis misplaced, or modulation disre-
garded, the words, though possessing volumes of thought,
may be rendered almost void of meaning.
Second. The sentiment may be so spoken as to leave its
plain meaning unaffected, neither adding to or taking from
the mere signification of the words. The listener, hearing,
and being familiar with the words, obtains an intellectual
knowledge of the thought expressed. He is impressed with
the words only to the degree that he is interested in the
thought. There is nothing in the presentation to attract his
attention, or that will awaken interest within him. Had he
seen the words in the skeleton forms of written language, the
effect would have been the same. They have been presented
to his sense alone.
Third.—The same sentiment may be spoken so that it shall
not only express the idea indicated, but that it shall impress
that idea upon the mind and heart. Under this character of

utterance we supplement the form of words with their power,
investing the mere passive clay with the life-giving principle
which shall send it forth an active, aggressive influence.
This we believe to be the original and legitimate design of
speech. It could not have been the purpose of the Creator
that this marvellous faculty should perform the service of a
mere dead machine. Correct, cultivated utterance gives
emphasis and spiritual effect to written language.
In the following pages the attention of teacher and student
has been directed prominently to the study of natural speech
as revealed by Conversation. It is believed that we may here
find nature most true, however crude, and that we may obtain
from her, models and inspiration for the more exalted con-
ditions of speech. Spoken language finds its original and
simplest forms in conversation.
The conditions of mind and body in ordinary conversation
are best adapted for the study of our own individuality. We
cannot study self when on exhibition. We dress up for
strangers. We spend much time and means to prepare our
bodies for distinguished company, not always with the most
happy effect. Sometimes it results in such a perversion of
our natural appearance as to give offence rather than
pleasure. So, in the expression of our thoughts, voice and
manner are modified by the presence of the multitude, and
sometimes, upon great occasions, they are so perverted as to
lose all that is natural and impressive. Thus thousands fail
of their just merit in presenting themselves to strangers. In
the effort to be natural they become unnatural. In their
attempt to represent themselves for what they are not, they
fail to receive value for what they are. Nature may be
pruned, cultured and directed, but we cannot substitute it.
I will always be stronger as myself than I can be as any
one else, and as we represent ourselves most through our
words, we should in our words be most true to ourselves.
We should study ourselves and seek our examples from that
condition where true nature is least modified. This condi-
tion we believe to be that of conversation with our intimate

friends. Conversation may be most faulty and corrupt, yet
we will find in it a harmony with our own natures, and con-
stantly recurring lights and shades of natural expression that
may serve as models for study and imitation, such as we can
find nowhere else in the whole range of utterance. But it is
not sufficient to find the germs. They must have growth
and maturity. The work of culture and development pre-
cedes the efficient use of all our faculties. Man, in the crea-
tion of his own being, is made a partner with God. We are
co-workers with God in self-construction. He gives us the
plastic material, with directions or laws for its use, condi-
tioning the result of the work upon the application of those
laws.
It is better to develop our own faculties, though inferior,
rather than to attempt to appropriate another's. Our own
will serves us better, because designed for us by the Creator,
and hence in harmony with our being. God will hold us
responsible for the talents He has given us. He does not
ask that we buy or borrow, but demands increase through
culture and development. The expression of thought and
feeling, therefore, should be in the simplest and purest har-
mony with the elements of our individual nature. But how
to find our true nature may prove our most difficult task.
We have been so misdirected that there has grown upon us
by observation and contamination, such a coating of man-
ners and habits foreign to the original, and we have acted so
long in sympathy with this accumulated surface that we may
hardly recognize our true selves. We have so long followed
the untrue that we may hardly know the true. We have so
long associated with this outer that we fail to comprehend
the inner. Habit has become so fixed as to constitute a second
nature, and close analysis becomes necessary that we may
draw the lines between our own nature and this accumulated
or borrowed nature. Our first work, then, is to distinguish
the true from the false, the original from the borrowed,
nature from habit, that we may develop, each in himself, the
original creation, rather than the warped and distorted crea-
tion of our own hands.

The author would here make grateful acknowledgment of
he assistance he has received in the preparation of this
work by those directly associated with him in the Institution
over which he presides. Mrs. Shoemaker, Prof. J. H. Bechtel,
and Prof. R. O. Moon, have furnished him the fruit of their
investigations in the several departments which they repre-
sent, and are worthy of more prominent mention than he
can here afford them. He does not forget the many friends
to whom he is indebted for suggestive help, for counsel,
and for encouragement.
That "Practical Elocution may contribute, in some
degree, to the elevation of a noble art, has been the aim,
and remains the earnest hope of the author.

INTRODUCTION,
ELOCUTION, from eloqui, to speak out, to express,
(e, out; and loqui, to speak,) as now applied,
contemplates the whole art of conveying thought
through the organs of the body.
Before entering directly upon the study of this
subject, we may receive a worthy inspiration in con-
sidering the broad and abundant opportunity which
opens to us.
Elocution concerns the commerce of
mind and soul. As such, it involves the capability on
the part of the student to comprehend, to appreciate,
ard to communicate thought and emotion. To this
end, he needs the best of all his powers. It is only the
voice that has reached its best, and the eye that
beams from the soul, and the hand of grace, and the
attitude of manhood and womanhood, that can convey
the immortality which has been breathed upon us.
By sin these powers have been enfeebled and
deformed and under its burn their deformity
increases. Guarded and regulated by the laws of
our creation, they may be rescued and made poten-
tial in conveying the very mind of the Creator.

EXPLANATION OF THE OUTLINE.
The several questions, placed in parentheses, are supposed to
natural order of inquiry in the mind of the student.
the
We open the discussion at that period when the meaning of the subject
being yet comparatively vague, the student asks: What is Elocution?
This question calls for
DEFINITION.
Having showr 'n the definition its scope and the field of culture which it
reludes, the inquiry is next pertinent: Of what use is it? or, What practi-
al bearing will it have upon my course in life?
These questions are answered by a consideration of its
IMPORTANCE.
First. IN PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT.-The correct use of the voice will
react in physical advantage to the speaker.
Second. IN SOCIAL LIFE.-It will give added power and influence.
➡ur business operations.
Third. IN BUSINESS LIFE.-It will reflect confidence and character upon
Fourth. IN PUBLIC LIFE.-It will impart accuracy, force and dignity to
ur expression, and will give us command over the multitude.
Convinced of its importance, the student is prepared to enter practically
pon tb work, and naturally inquires: Where commence the study?
CONVERSATION.
The i. quiry leads to Conversation as the natural germ, which, properly
ultivated, will produce excellence in speech.
In order to the cultivation of Conversation it will be necessary to correct
he common habit of speech; hence,
voice by the vocal organs. Hence, first under this head, is the Cultivation
of the VOICE.
The second step in the process of speech is the shaping or moulding of
this material into distinct or separate forms by the organs of speech.
These forms are known as Elementary Sounds, and are treated under
ARTICULATION.
The third step is the adaptation of these sounds to the meanings they
nave been made to repres nt, or EXPRESSION.
VOICE Culture divides itself naturally into Theory and Practice, or
PHILOSOPHY OF VOICE and UTTERANCE.
PHILOSOPHY OF VOICE treats of the mechanism and functions of the
PRINCIPLES
Concern SPEECH and GESTURE, the two great mediums of natural expression.
SPELCH.-The first step in the formation of speech is the production of
voice.
UTTERANCE has two objects, the development and quality of the voice.
Development or power of voice is obtained by the exercise of the several
organs producing it, hence, Breathing Exercises, Vocal Exercises, Gymnastics.
Quality, or Kind of Voice, is divided, in harmony with sentiment, iuto
Pure and Impure, with their several subdivisions of Simple Pure, Orotund,
Pectoral, Guttural, Aspirated and Falsetto.
ARTICULATION-DEFINITION.-CLASSIFICATION is given according to the
several elements of which sounds are composed, viz.: Voice Sounds, Breath
Sounds, Union Sounds.
EXPRESSION calls into play the intellectual and emotional faculties, and
produces its effects through the MODULATIONS of Quality, Pitch, Force, Time,
and Slides.
GESTURE is the second great medium of Natural Expression.
POSITION reflects the general character of the thought.
MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY emphasize and illustrate sentiment and feel-
First, CONVERSATION FOR ITS OWN SAKE. Correct habits of conversation ing.
established, it will be considered
Second, IN ITS RELATION TO READING, and
Third, IN ITS RELATION TO PUBLIC ADDRESS.
For the broader fields of expression, these germs of voice and manner,
ound in conversation, will demand a broader culture and development,
eral principles are involved.
and the student inquires, How pursue the study? To this end certain gen-
FACIAL EXPRESSION, next to voice itself, gives intelligent effect to lan-
guage.
With the discussion of Principles we obtain the theory necessary to the
personal application of our subject.
The teacher will desire processes of imparting successfully the science and
art which he has acquired, and will ask: How teach it?
He is answered under the general head of
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION,
to which have been given the natural subdivisions of PRIMARY INSTRUCTION
and ADVANCED INSTRUCTION.

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
DEFINITION.
Elocution relates to manner or style in speaking.
Good Elocution consists in the natural expression
of thought by speech and gesture.
Note 1. Natural must be understood as applying to our
highest or God-nature, and should be carefully distinguished
from habit or second nature.
Note 2. The term expression is strengthened, if understood
to include conveyance or passage, as of a body from one
place to another.
Note 3. Thought has here its broadest application, and
signifies feeling and passion as well as sentiment. We should
convey not only the idea contained in the thought, we should
also convey the impression made upon us by the thought.
Note 4. Speech covers every intelligent use of the organs
of speech, articulate and inarticulate, whispered and vocal.
Note 5. Gesture concerns position and facial expression,
as well as movements of the body.
Note 6. Thus it will be seen that correct elocutionary
training is the subordination of the entire physical being to
the service of mind and spirit, thought being the product of
the inner or spiritual man, and speech and gesture its natural
outlet through the exterior or physical man.


## p. 21 (#23) ##############################################

IMPORTANCE.
21
IMPORTANCE.
IN PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT.
Elocution calls into play the most vital organs of the
human body, the correct use of the voice constituting an
important source of grace and strength to these organs.
It will demand correct posture and proper habits of res-
piration; it will afford healthful exercise to the throat and
lungs; it will bring the intercostal muscles into vigorous
action; it will give natural stimulant to the circulation, so
that the organs of digestion and the entire physical system
participate in the benefit.
It is justly claimed that no other exercise will call forth
so natural and uniform an action of the whole system, as the
proper exercise of the voice.
IN SOCIAL LIFE.
It is in social life that we mould character, and exert the
most lasting influences. These influences are exerted through
word and deed. Word and deed receive their character, in
a great degree, through voice and manner. We will, there-
fore, render our influence agreeable and effective, largely
in proportion as the voice and manner are pleasing and
attractive.
Temperament, disposition and motive will be measured
by their outward expression. If this expression is coarse,
abrupt, and unattractive, the inner life will be exposed to a
corresponding verdict; and in proportion as this expression
becomes natural and refined will the verdict be changed.


## p. 22 (#24) ##############################################

22
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
Our happiness and usefulness, therefore, in the social rela-
tions must depend greatly upon the culture of these qualities..
It is further important, because our social relations include
our best friends, and they should receive from us the best we
have, and in our best manner.
IN BUSINESS LIFE.
Other things being equal, a man will succeed in business
largely as he can address himself upon his wares, be they
mechanical, physical, mental or moral.
He will succeed through the capability of winning atten-
tion to his business.
The same power which gives influence in the social sphere,
will attract to our business operations.
Character of tone and dignity of manner will reflect re-
liability upon our vocation or profession.
IN PUBLIC LIFE.
It will enable us to give accuracy and fulness of meaning
to our words, and to convey the spirit of the thought to the
hearer.
Words are but the dead forms of thought. The human
voice may breathe into them the breath of life and make
them living influences.
Elocution will give that culture by which we may please
the eye and the ear, so that our words shall be presentca
favorably to the judgment. It will also add that force and
dignity to expression, and that confidence of manner which
will command the multitude.
A single sentence may be the exponent of years of study
and experience, and it is possible only by the most carefu
practice in the art of expression to pronounce such a sen-
tence with corresponding effect.


## p. 23 (#25) ##############################################

CONVERSATION.
23
CONVERSATION.
Conversation is the simplest and most common form of
human expression.
It contains the germs of all speech and action, and therefore
constitutes the basis of oratorical and dramatic delivery. We
exercise these germs of speech and action most in conver-
sation; it is therefore natural that we should here form our
most permanent habits of expression.
These habits will control, not only our conversation, but, as
hereafter shown, they will, in a great degree, affect our
reading and public address.
The importance, therefore, of acquiring in the common
intercourse of life, correct habits of voice and manner cannot
be overestimated. Hence, the consideration, first, of
CONVERSATION FOR ITS OWN SAKE.
No higher art is possible to man than the art of transmit-
ting, naturally and effectively, in common intercourse, the
sentiments and feelings of which he is capable.
This art includes chaste and appropriate language, and
grace and variety of manner, as well as the purity and adap-
tation of speech. It is, however, only the latter phase of the

subject that will concern us in this treatment, namely, correct
speech. To this end, the student should secure the criticism
of the ear upon his own and others' Conversation, by atten-
tion-

ment.

TO THE VOICE.
TO THE ARTICULATION.
TO THE EXPRESSION.
Voice.-The Voice should be natural, pure, and full.
NOTE.-The long vowel sounds, marked "Naturally," as given in the table
of "Vocal Exercises," and such Conversational Sentences as are here given,
should be carefully practiced.
Articulation.-The Articulation should be correct and distinct.
NOTE.-Master the table of Elementary Sounds and practice the various
accompanying exercises.
Expression.-The Expression should be adapted to the senti-
NOTE.-The intelligent student will readily discover some of the leading
relations of sound to sense; such, for instance, as that of gayety, solemnity,
pathos, &c. Attention to these in practice, will lead to the discovery of other
and closer relations, until every sentiment will suggest, promptly, its corres-
ponding tone.
SUMMARY.-Voice, Articulation, and Expression, as here
defined, may be termed the a, b, c of speech.
SUGGESTION TO STUDENTS.
Every observing student will be able to detect errors with
reference to the several points here named. His ear will be
sufficiently critical to distinguish one or more of the many
faults common to conversational voice. He will also detect
sluggishness of articulation and the habitual use of incorrect
sounds. He will perceive, to some degree, or in some particu-
lar, a want of adaptation to the sentiment expressed. In
other words, his knowledge is beyond his practice, and no
more important counsel can be given upon this subject than
the following:


## p. 25 (#27) ##############################################

CONVERSATIONAL EXERCISES.
25
1. Listen to your conversation with reference to the several
elements named.
2. Correct, in conversation, that which you know to be
faulty.
3. Allow no occasion to be so unimportant as to admit of
loose or incorrect speech.
By this practice, the ear will observe the speech of those
more correct than yourself, and will lead you to discover more
and more closely your habitual faults, and thus to elevate
and purify your conversation.
CONVERSATIONAL EXERCISES.
These exercises represent a broad variety of conversational
styles and should be carefully practiced with reference to the
voice, the articulation and the expression, according to
the preceding treatment.
1. "Good morning, Mr. Jones, I am glad to see you. When
did you arrive in the city?
"I came in by the last train."
"I hope you left your family well."
66
'Very well, thank you."
"You will call upon us before you go back?"
"I will, thank you."
"Good morning, sir."
"Good morning."
2. Is John at home?
Is your father well?
When will you go?
What is your name?
What time have you?
Did you arrive by the night train?
Have you to-day's paper?
What is the news?
Did you see our mutual friend, Mr. Wilson?
Have you been well? You look ill.
NOTE. The practice of questions, such as these, will be found of great ad-
vantage in gaining natural expression. They should be varied in emphasis and
inflection.

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
3. We have demonstrations enough, fortunately, to show
that truth alone is not sufficient; for truth is the arrow, but
man is the bow that sends it home. There be many men
who are the light of the pulpit, whose thought is profound,
whose learning is universal, but whose offices are unspeakably
dull. They do make known the truth, but without fervor,
without grace, without beauty, without inspiration; and
discourse upon discourse would fitly be called the funeral of
important subjects!-Henry Ward Beecher.

younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the por-

his living. And not many days after, the younger son gathered
all together, and took his journey into a far country, and
there wasted his substance with riotous living. And when
he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land;
and he began to be in want.-Luke xv: 11-14.

6. "It won't do to let John see me in this position," I said;
and so, with a mighty effort, I disengaged myself from the
pack, flung off the blanket from around my neck, and seizing
hold of a spruce limb, which I could fortunately reach, drew
myself slowly up. I had just time to jerk the rifle out of the
mud, and fish up about half of the trout, when John came
struggling along."
"John," said I, leaning unconcernedly against a tree, as if
nothing had happened," John, put down the boat, here's a
splendid spot to rest."
Well, Mr. Murray," queried John, as he emerged from
under the boat, "how are you getting along?"
66
Capitally!" said I; "the carry is very level when you
once get down to it. I felt a little out of breath, and I
thought I would wait for you a few moments."
"
"What's your boots doing up there in that tree?" ex-
claimed John, as he pointed up to where they hung dangling
from the limb, about fifteen feet above our heads.
66
"Boots doing!" said I, why, they are hanging there,
don't you see? You did'nt suppose I'd drop them into this
mud, did you?"
"Why, no," replied John, "I don't suppose you would;
but how about this?" continued he, as he stooped down and
pulled a big trout, tail foremost, out of the soft muck"; "how
did that trout come there?"
"It must have got out of the pail somehow," I responded.
"I thought I heard something drop just as I sat down."
I thought John would split with laughter, but my time
came, for as in one of his paroxysms he turned partly
around, I saw that his back was covered with mud clear up
to his hat.
"Do you always sit down on your coat, John," I inquired,
"when you cross a carry like this?"-W. H. H. Murray.

buxom face in the bright morning. The buds began slowly to
expand their close winter folds, the dark and melancholy
woods to assume an almost imperceptible purple tint; and
here and there a little chirping bluebird hopped about the
orchards. Strips of fresh green appeared along the brooks,
now released from their icy fetters; and nests of little varie
gated flowers, nameless, yet richly deserving a name, sprang
up in the sheltered recesses of the leafless woods.

Nor say, indeed, 'tis wholly new;
But true or false, or new or old,
I think you'll find it fairly told.
A
enchman, who had ne'er before
Set foot upon a foreign shore,
Weary of home, resolved to go
And see what Holland had to show.
He didn't know a word of Dutch,
But that could hardly grieve him much;
He thought, as Frenchmen always do,
That all the world could "parley-voo."-J. G. Saxe.

and that he that wants money, means, and content, is without
three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and

great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that
hath learned no wit by nature or art may complain of good
breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.-Shakespeare.
10. "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the
ground; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and
the man became a living soul." How wonderful is breath!
It comes to us in the soft summer morning laden with the
perfume of flowers; but ere it reaches us it has kissed a thou-
sand scented leaves. The birds soar aloft in this mysterious
ether, pouring their triumphal songs on its resonant bosom;
and the butterfly and buzzing insect, "like winged flowers
and flying gems," sparkle and shimmer in their dazzling
beauty.
But, whether it brings upon its waves the mutterings of the
coming storm, or the merry, ringing laugh of childhood-the
awful booming of the heavy cannonade, or the silvery tones
of the violin-it is air, such as we breathe. Oh! then let it
become a thing of joy to us. Let us learn to make it a thing
of beauty, wreathing embodied thoughts in vocal gems of
purity and sweetness, that shall gladden the ears of all who
listen.-Bronson.

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
CONVERSATION IN ITS RELATION TO READING.
a. ANALOGY.
With reference to Expression, Conversation may be defined
the utterance of our own thoughts in our own words, to one
or a few individuals.
Reading is the utterance of the author's thought in the
author's words, to one or many individuals.
We use, in Conversation, the same voice or material, and
the same forms of sound, and call into exercise the same
thoughts, feelings and passions as in Reading.
The Cultivation of these powers for Conversation will give
them cultivation for Reading, and inasmuch as we converse
more than we read, it is at once apparent that we have in
Conversation the greater opportunity for their cultivation.
b. DISTINCTION.
The distinction between Conversation and Reading is two-
fold.
First.-Reading carries us beyond the province of Conversation,
when it is addressed to a large collection of persons. This dis-
tinction involves the same consideration as the distinction
between Conversation and Public Address, and will be treated
under the next head.
Second.-The Second distinction is found in the mechanical
difficulty of expressing the author's language as naturally as we
do our own. We have observed that Conversation is the
expression of thought in our own words. These words being
`chosen from our common vocabulary, are familiar to the
organs of speech, and are, therefore, uttered without labored
effort.
The same is true of conversational constructions. Such
constructions are used as have become habitual to the

•
speaker, and the mechanical labor of their utterance is
avoided. In Reading, words and constructions are often
foreign to the habit of the speaker, and their expression must
necessarily manifest, at first, the mechanism of their utter-
ance. It is, therefore, necessary, in Reading, to give that
practice to the language which will render the utterance as
familiar as that of our common Conversation.
NOTE. From the above, it is proper to observe that skill in reading at sight
can be acquired only by the habitual use of the words in common usage, and by
familiarity with the various styles of written language. This suggests the im-
portance of a broad vocabulary in familiar speech and of much reading aloud
from writers of good style.
C. MODELS.
It has been shown in the above discussion, that when the
author's language has become as familiar as our own there will
exist a perfect analogy. between Conversation and Reading.
It has also been previously shown that Conversation is the
original and natural source of all true expression. We will,
therefore, find in correct and natural Conversation the
truest and purest models from which to copy in our Reading.
As the landscape or forest will furnish the painter original
models for his art, so will Conversation furnish original
models of sentiment, emotion and passion for the Reader's
art. In reading, therefore, we should express the language of the
author as we would utter the same language under the same cir
cumstances in pure conversation.
NOTE 1.-In Impersonation, the Reader will necessarily depart from the basis
of his own Conversation to the imitation of the character impersonated.
NOTE 2.-Intelligent Reading presupposes that the Reader comprehend the
thought, and that in its expression he sympathize with the author's meaning;
these requirements precede the expression of language under all circumstances.

CONVERSATION IN ITS RELATION TO PUBLIC ADDRESS.
a. ANALOGY.
Read carefully the corresponding discussion under the
previous topic; it has the same force and bearing in the
treatment of this division of the subject.
b. DISTINCTION.
Conversation and Public Address both concern the con-
veyance of thought to the individual.
The distinction consists only in the greater accuracy and
intensity necessary in Public Address to overcome the ob-
stacles of number and space.
This refers to the distinction between the delivery of the
same sentence before the multitude, and its delivery to a
single individual. Passages, differing in sentiment, will be
expressed differently in Conversation, and will preserve a cor-
responding difference if delivered publicly..
ILLUSTRATION.
European guides know about enough English to tangle
everything up, so that a man can make neither head nor
tail of it. They know their story by heart,-the history of
every statue, painting, cathedral or other wonder they show
you. They know it and tell it as a parrot would, -and if
you interrupt and throw them off the track, they have to go
back and begin over again. All their lives long they are
employed in showing strange things to foreigners and listen-
ing to their bursts of admiration.-" Innocents Abroad"-

But this very day, an honest man, my neighbor-there

the badge of Ursini, because, forsooth, he tossed not high
his ready cap in air, nor lifted up his voice in servile shouts,
at sight of that great ruffian!-Rienzi to the Romans.
We have here three sentences differing widely in character
and demanding different forms of expression; the difference,
however, exists in the sentences themselves—the first being
simply conversational, the second bold and oratorical, the
third impassioned and dramatic.
This difference will manifest itself in their utterance in
familiar discourse, where the key to their individual expression
will be found. Their delivery before the audience will in-
volve no other distinction than that of increased accuracy
and intensity. In each case the Conversational form, peculiar
to the sentence, should be carefully preserved.
As the picture thrown upon the screen is preserved in
form, but magnified in all its proportions, so in public
speech, care should be exercised to preserve the natural or
conversational form, while, in due proportion of voice and
manner, there is added earnestness and intensity.
NOTE.-Every student should make himself familiar with the following:
GUIDE TO PUBLIC ADDRESS.—The manner of expression by
which I may convey a thought most impressively to a single
individual, will best convey it to two; the only change dic-
tated by nature or reason being such simple change as the
alternation of the eye from one to the other. The same
manner of expression will best convey the same thought to a
dozen, with the necessary change in intensity of voice and
gesture; this individual basis will furnish the most impres-
sive form for the utterance of the same sentiment to a

thousand, supplemented by a power of voice and earnest-
ness of gesture adapted to the number and the space.
REMARKS.-Audiences are made up of individual souls,
not one of which loses its individual character because in
juxtaposition with another. The soul of an audience can only
be reached by reaching the individual souls that compose it.
An individual being addressed, each person regards himself
the individual, and accordingly appropriates the thought; and
each having received the thought, all have received it. We
submit that there is no one fault among public speakers
more common, or one more baneful than the habit of
addressing a mass of individuals as if their souls had also
massed, and that, therefore, they must resort to some unnat-
ural and monstrous means of access to it.
C. MODELS.
Conversation being the source of all true expression, it
must be at once apparent that we shall here find our highest
models for Public Speech, needing only enlargement accord-
ing to the demand. Pure, chaste Conversation is at once
the highest Oratory, and true Oratory should be so lost in pure
simplicity that it shall be but noble Conversation.
GENERAL SUMMARY OF CONVERSATION.
Conversation is natural communication to the individual.
All speech is natural communication to the individual;
therefore all speech is Conversation. Reading and Public
Address are but modified forms of Conversation, and are so
closely allied to it that excellence in Conversation will se-
eure excellence in Reading and Public Address.

PRINCIPLES.
It has been shown that the germs of Elocution are found
native in pure Conversation. Principles will concern the
processes of their growth and development. These germs
are found in Speech and Gesture, which are the two great
mediums of communication.
SPEECH.
Speech is the most direct and the most important instru-
ment for the conveyance of thought. By it men are put in
possession of the thoughts and experiences of their fellow-
men, so that the development of mind itself may be said to
depend greatly upon Speech.
The organs uniting in its production are the vocal organs
for voice, the organs of speech for articulation, and the intel-
lectual and emotional faculties for expression. Hence the
subdivisions-Voice, Articulation, Expression.
NOTE.-The term organs of speech, as applied here, used in its technical
sense, and includes, prominently, the lips, tongue, teeth, palate and nasal
organs.
VOICE.
Voice is the principal material of which speech is made."
Its cultivation is closely related to the whole subject of
Elocution, and therefore claims the most careful attention
of the student.
The cultivation of the Voice will depend upon judicious
85

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
exercise, in harmony with the natural law of human de
velopment.
Intelligent investigation and broad experience have estab-
lished the fact that voice is the product of a physical
mechanism, as well-defined as the muscles of the arm or the
tissue of the brain, and that its development follows a law of
our being, as simple and as natural as that by which the
arm moves or the brain thinks.
It is, however, worthy of observation that the voice does
not ordinarily receive power or culture, even from the
most constant exercise, but it does not follow that it therefore
departs from the recognized law of development, but rather
that the customary habits of its use are unwise, mistaken,
and founded in ignorance of its structure. The operations
of the vocal instrument are so subtle and the liability to false
practice so great, that it becomes a matter of primary impor-
tance that the student be directed to its use in his earliest
exercises. To this end voice is here presented, in its theory
and practice, under the two heads, Philosophy of Voice and
Utterance.
PHILOSOPHY OF VOICE.
Philosophy of Voice concerns the structure of the instrument,
its use,
and its management, and therefore includes its anatomy,
physiology and hygiene.
Voice is the result of the vibratory motion produced by
the action of breath upon the vocal cords. The parts imme-
diately involved are therefore the Organs of Respiration and
the Vocal Cords.
The lungs may be properly regarded as the centre of the
Respiratory System. They are the great reservoirs, where the
motive power of the Voice is concentrated.
Directly beneath and immediately connected with the
ngs is the diaphragm, or movable wall of muscular partition
tween the cavity of the chest and the cavity of the abdo-
nen. This, together with the abdominal muscles, which
ntrol its movements, may be compared to the handle of

PRINCIPLES-UTTERANCE.
37
a bellows, of which the lungs constitute the body. The
application of power to these muscles, either in the act
of breathing or speaking, is immediately communicated
to the lungs, causing the escape of air, or exhalation. The
corresponding inhalation is controlled by the relaxation of
these muscles and the consequent depression of the dia-
phragm. Their proper action constitutes the primary power
of respiration, and therefore bears an important relation to
the production of tone.
Above the lungs, and connected with them by the trachea
or windpipe, is that wonderful conformation of cartilages
muscles and ligaments, known as the Larynx, in which are
located the Vocal Cords, whence all tone or voice immediately
*proceeds.
The Vocal Cords consist of two slight, elastic bands, situated
in the larynx a short distance above its juncture with the
trachea, and immediately below its outward projection,
known as the "Adam's apple." These bands adhere so
closely to the walls of the throat as to be scarcely distin-
guishable by the aid of the laryngoscope; but in the act of
voice production they are thrown forward into the current
of air escaping from the lungs, and the thin membrane
covering their surface is thus excited to rapid vibration,
which, receiving resonance and volume from the cavity of
the chest and from the mouth, escapes from the lips a per-
fect creation-voice.
UTTERANCE.
From the preceding brief explanation, it will be easily
understood that the parts of the system involved in the pro-
duction of voice are, in the order of their use, the Abdomi-
nal Muscles, the Lungs, and the Vocal Cords. The cavity of
the mouth also contributes much to the purity and richness
of the tone. These several parts exist in every perfect
organization, and may be termed the muscular implements
of the human voice.


## p. 38 (#40) ##############################################

38
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
Utterance is the technical term given to all sounds emana-
ting from this vocal instrument, whether whispered or vocal,
and is the result of the opposition offered to the escape of
the air-current, by the projection of the vocal cords across
the trachea. Utterance, therefore, implies such an applica-
tion of breath upon the vocal cords, and such control of
them, as to produce sound or voice. It may be regarded
simply as practical voice-production, and will be treated
with reference to its development and its quality.
DEVELOPMENT.
A well-developed voice imparts force and dignity to every
relation of life. It is the first step toward culture in the art
of Elocution. The distinctive aim in vocal development is
to secure that purity, power and flexibility which must unite
to give character to the voice.
Rapid and healthful development will depend upon correct
breathing, combined with judicious, systematic and vigorous
vocal and physical exercise.
BREATHING.
Respiration or breathing is defined as the process by which
air is taken into the lungs and expelled from them. It is
the motive power of the voice. The following seems a
natural order of treatment:
а.
What we breathe.
b. Why we breathe.
How we breathe.
c.
d. Breathing exercises.
What we breathe.-Health, happiness and existence itself
depend upon the quality of air we breathe. Pure air alone
can promote natural activity and buoyancy in the physica-
being.


## p. 39 (#41) ##############################################

PRINCIPLES-BREATHING.
39
Why we breathe.-We breathe to supply the system with
oxygen; to releave the body of waste and useless matter, and
for the purposes of speech-breathing being the great agent of
human utterance. Respiration also promotes the heal hy devel-
opment of the parts by which it is carried on. The intercostal
muscles are afforded exercise by breathing; the lungs are
rendered capacious and flexible; the muscles of the waist
and back are strengthened, and the whole body is given
added symmetry and comeliness.
How we breathe.-Healthful respiration is carried on through
the nostrils. This is illustrated, notably, in the breathing of
animals, savages, and healthy children. The throat and lungs
are thus protected from the impurities and severity of the
atmosphere, either of which tends to produce irritation and
disease.
By the habit of deep and full inspiration. Every part within
the whole range of the respiratory system should be ex-
erted with each successive breath. Exercise is a condition
of health and strength as absolute as food or air itself.
Failing for a time to exercise any part of this marvellous
organism, we have weakened the part in proportion to the
time it has been inactive. Weakness begets weakness and
diminished lung power will impair both the quality and the
power of the voice.
EXERCISES IN BREATHING.
1. Chest Breathing.-Relax the muscles of the chest. Take'
a full inspiration and expand the chest to its fullest capacity.
Give out the breath gradually.
2. Costal Breathing.-Distend the sides while inhaling and
relax gradually with slow and regular exhalation.
3. Waist Breathing.-Inhale with the view of expanding
the entire circle of the waist.
4. Dorsal Breathing.-Inhale as if endeavoring to thrust
out the muscles of the back by the force of the air.
5. Abdominal Breathing.-Breathe deeply, forcing the

abdominal muscles outward. Let them sink as much as
possible during exhalation.
6. Full Breathing.-Inhale slowly and exercise the will
upon all parts of the body, simultaneously. This may be
regarded a union of all the previous exercises, and is but an
intensified form of what should be the natural habit of
breathing.
7. Prolonged Breathing.-Prolong the exercise of Full
Breathing.
8. Effusive Breathing.-Inhale naturally. Give out the
breath in the sound of the letter h, as gently and gradually
as possible.
9. Expulsive Breathing.-Inhale as in Full Breathing and
expel the air forcibly but gradually upon the sound of the
letter h.
10. Explosive Breathing.-Take full breath, expel suddenly
and with force in a whispered utterance of the word Ha.
NOTE 1-An active position should be observed in the above exercises, the
body carefully erect, arms akimbo, and fingers bearing upon the abdominal
muscles, except as they may be changed to the part upon which the exercise is
directed.
NOTE 2.-These exercises should be used with as much caution and regularity
as any other gymnastic exercise. They should be commenced gradually and
discontinued if any sensation of dizziness is experienced. It will be observed
that the series is progressive in its character, giving it special advantage to
persons not accustomed to habits of full breathing, and to invalids.
VOCAL EXERCISES.
The following table of Vocal Exercises is designed to rep-
resent the principal forms which the voice assumes in
response to the various classes of sentiment and passion.
Let it be understood, however, that these forms are ever
changing in degree and direction. Nature rarely repeats
herself with mathematical exactness. The leaves of the tree
are of a kind, but not alike. Members of a family frequently
resemble one another, but never is the likeness of one ex-
actly reproduced in another. So the countenance of a person

"
not only changes under different impressions and emotions,
but an impression repeated will rarely repeat itself exactly
upon the countenance.
No arbitrary form for the voice is therefore suggested by
these characters, but if disciplined to produce readily, and
in pure quality, the several forms here suggested, it will
respond naturally to corresponding sentiments and emotions.
They should be practiced until the speaker can produce
them easily and confidently in any order and in any degree.
This done, they will then take their place in speech, without
effort, as promptly as the countenance will lighten in the
presence of an unexpected friend, or darken at sudden dis-
appointment or sorrow.

EXPLANATION OF THE PRECEDING TABLE.
1. Natural.-Place the organs of speech in correct posi
tion for the sound to be uttered. The vocal cords will
take their place without any conscious act. The natural
flow of the air in exhalation will produce the purest tone of
which the organs are capable, and in the simplest manner.
The correct use of the breath will be determined by a slight
depression of the abdominal muscles and the barely con-
scious stroke of the diaphragm upon the lower part of the
lungs. To produce a pure tone, the lower jaw should be
slightly projected, the throat well opened. This will be
shown by a greater fullness in the outer muscles.
The greatest care should be observed in this exercise, inasmuch
as future vocalization will depend upon the correctness of these
natural sounds.
2. With Full Force.-Apply the abdominal muscles with
full force upon the diaphragm, so that the volume of air
may be brought to hear with great power upon the vocal
cords. This action should not be abrupt or violent, but firm
and decisive.
8. High and Low.-It is designed here to apply the pre-
ceding two exercises at different points within the natural
compass of the voice. It is not designed to anticipate the
more thorough cultivation of pitch as a special modulation.
4. Effusive. This exercise consists in the pouring forth or
effusing of the simplest natural tone.
5. Expulsive. With a forcible action of the abdominal
muscles and well-expanded chest, strike the tone as in Full
Force, but let the volume of sound diminish more gradually.
6. Explosive-Strike the diaphragm with violent and
abrupt action of the abdominal muscles, and aim to produce
a burst of voice which shall fall upon the ear clear and sud-
den.
7. With Swell-Beginning with Effusive, expand slowly to
the degree of Full Force, releasing the action as gradually

PRINCIPLES-VOCAL EXERCISES.
43
as it was begun. Purity and regularity in the increase and
decrease of the tone will report the correctness of the physi-
cal action.
8. With Sustained Force.-Exert the muscles of the body
as in Full Force. Hold them firm and steady, terminating
the tension abruptly.
9. Tremor.-Prolong the sounds, either in Natural or Full
Force, making the voice tremulous by a corresponding
action of the muscles of the chest.
10.
With Full Breathing.-Concentrate the greatest possi-
ble force upon a single tone-more violent than in Full
Force and less abrupt than in Explosive. The utterance
should be preceded by a full inhalation and then produced
by such a culmination of power as could not be sustained or
repeated without renewed breath.
The student should remember that, in order to obtain the best
results from these exercises, there should be in each a corresponding
action of the mind.
In the natural, the thought should be unimpassioned. In
full force, there should be great purpose in the mind. In
high and low, there should be some corresponding mental
condition of joy or victory in the one, and solemnity or awe
in the other. The Effusive should be marked by a spirit of
reflective tenderness; the explosive, by impulsive vehemence;
the swell, by an expansion of mind and soul. In sustained force,
the thought should be sustained with the exercise. In tremor,
the whole being should at once be possessed with the sense
of pity, grief, or deep sympathy. In full breathing, there
should be the greatest possible concentration of soul power.
And in all, from the most natural to the most violent, there
should be repose and self-possession, so that the exercise
may be the result of the best condition of mind and body.
NOTE.-The following exercises should be practiced until the student can

1. Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth,
while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when
thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; while the sun,

the clouds return after the rain.-Bible.

3. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long
established should not be changed for light and transient
causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that
mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are suffera-

which they are accustomed. But when a long train of
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object,
evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it
is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government,
and to provide new guards for their future security.

She thanked me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. On this hint I spake;
She loved me for the dangers I had passed;
And I loved her that she did pity them.
This is the only witchcraft which I've used.

1. Meantime, the tramp, tramp, tramp, sounds on,-the
tramp of sixty thousand yearly victims. Some are besotted
and stupid, some are wild with hilarity, and dance along the
dusty way, some reel along in pitiful weakness, some wreak
their mad and murderous impulses on the helpless women
and children whose destinies are united to theirs, some go
bound in chains from which they seek in vain to wrench
their bleeding wrists, and all are poisoned in body and soul,
and all are doomed to death.-J. G. Holland.

drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains

From lake to lake the tempest grew,
With wakening swell,
Till proud oppression crouched for shame,
And Austria's haughtiness grew tame;
And Freedom's watchword was the name
Of William Tell.

and madness, if uneasiness under salutary and necessary re-

alone its existence is made sure, it will stand, in the end, by

GYMNASTICS.
Physical force and muscular elasticity are indispensable to
high attainment in vocal development. A vigorous and
flexible tone can only be produced within a flexible and
vigorous body. Vigor and flexibility of body are depend-
ent upon exercise. It is a condition of professional life
to lack opportunity of such manual labor as will develop
strength of body. Even if manual labor were associated
with intellectual, it would not give that symmetry of form
and grace of movement so necessary to the speaker. Ex-
ercises for the cultivation of physical strength and of ease
in movement, were held in high esteem by the ancients,
and are latterly receiving a degree of that attention which
they deserve.
The following exercises have been selected and adapted
from Prof. Welch's System of Physical Culture. Such
exercises have been taken from the different series of Free

PRINCIPLES-QUALITY OF VOICE.
59
QUALITY.
The marvellous capacity of the human voice arises from
its adaptation to the ever-changing phases of human ex-
pression. Under careful culture it attunes itself to the
almost infinite diversity of thought and feeling. The term
“quality," when applied to tone, indicates those distinctive
properties or characteristics which the voice should assume
under these varying influences. These qualities constitute, of
themselves, an unmistakable language, more potent even
than words, and should be carefully cultivated by the student
as the very alphabet of expression. Thought and emotion,
as the direct emanations of the heart, embrace not only the
true, the beautiful, and the good, but through the effects of
sin, include its baser passions, and its weaknesses. In obedi-
ence to this dominant law of mind and soul, voice finds its
first natural division into Pure and Impure qualities.
PURE QUALITY.
Pure quality of voice is the language of pure thought; it
proceeds from the combined and harmonious action of all
the vocal parts, and is marked by a clear, smooth, and com.
manding resonance, which is at once the result and the ex-
ponent of a natural and serene condition of mind and body.
In respect to its degrees of force and its varied field of ex-
pression, it is divided into Simple Pure and Orotund.
SIMPLE PURE VOICE is the voice of pure conversation. It is
the basis of all the other qualities of tone, and is the natural
starting-point of culture. Here common faults of voice
must be overcome, and correct habits permanently estab-
lished; and since upon the proper understanding and pro-
duction of this tone all subsequent culture must depend, the

possession of absolute purity here cannot be too strongly in-
sisted upon.
The student should secure this quality before
attempting to practice the impure tones. It corresponds
with the natural, as described in the "Table of Vocal Exer-
cises," on page 41, and the direction for its production
there given, should be carefully followed.
Simple Pure Voice is used in simple narration, plain de-
scription, and the great field of unemotional language.
OROTUND VOICE is the symmetrical enlargement of Simple
Pure Voice, and is produced by a corresponding expansion
of all the organs used in the production of natural tone.
This quality of tone in its full development may be justly
termed the highest character of human utterance. It com-
bines the two great essentials of perfect speech, purity and
power, and unites in its production the highest purpose of
mind and the best condition of body.
Orotund Voice is the language of sublime and exalted
thought, lofty sentiment, and grand description.
EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE PURE.

though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil;
my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the

IMPURE QUALITY.
Impure voice denotes a disturbed condition of mind, and
results from a corresponding unnatural and unequal effort
upon the vocal cords. lɩ varies in form and character ac-
cording to the prevailing trait of the passion of which it
becomes the language.
Impure voice is subdivided into Pectoral, Guttural, Aspi-
rated and Falsetto.
These subdivisions, with their natural modifications of
intensity. cover an important field of expression. It should
however, be understood that these divisions are not arbi-
trary creations of the elocutionist, but are the natural phy-
sical effects of passion, as revealed by observation and study.
It is an established physiological fact that when the soul be-
comes agitated by some violent emotion, the nervous im-
pulse thus awakened, rushing through the avenues of the
body, becomes suddenly the controlling agency of the whole
physical system. The eye flashes, the muscles of the face
and arm betray the newly awakened influence, and, in sym-
pathy with this general physical excitement, the vocal organs
are disturbed, and the voice instantly reflects this changed
relation. It loses its natural purity and becomes the agent
and symbol of the passion that propels it. To this is due the
rigidity of the cords in the harsh, steely tone of hatred, their
unnatural tension in the language of terror, and the whole

phenomena of voice transition. Indeed, so marked is this
physical relation between passion and tone that it is at once
recognized by every condition of man, and even by the brute
creation.
PECTORAL.
The Pectoral quality of voice is used in the expression of
remorse, horror, dread, deep solemnity, and in the represen-
tation of the supernatural. It is the result of a relaxed condi-
tion of the vocal cords and a feeble and lifeless action of the
abdominal muscles.
GUTTURAL.
The Guttural quality of voice is known as a throat tone.
When carefully controlled, it is an element of great power
and energy. It denotes all those states of mind classed
under dislike and ill-humor. It also appears in the ferocity
of rage and revenge. The prominent characteristic of this
tone is its harsh, discordant quality, produced by the com-
pression and partial closing of the throat above the glottis.
NOTE.-This form of impurity is the most prevalent fault of voice; and the
greatest care should be taken to confine it to the expression of the sentiments
above enumerated.
ASPIRATED.
The Aspirate quality of voice is the language of secrecy,
caution, surprise, fear, and certain forms of anger. It arises
from the escape of unvocalized breath and may consist of
any of the other qualities of voice, modified by strong breath-
ing. It also includes the whisper.
FALSETTO.
Falsetto voice is generally produced above the natural
tone, and is used in the imitation of high female voices, in
the voices of children, and in affectation, terror, &c.

ARTICULATION.
Articulation consists in a correct and distinct utterance of
the elementary sounds in syllables and words. In nearly all of
the many definitions given by lexicographers and elocutionists,
the prevailing idea has been distinctness. While this idea is a
proper one, it is possible to be distinct and yet not correct,
in which case the very distinctness makes the incorrectness
more apparent. In the process of articulation the organs of
speech constitute what may be termed a set of moulds, capa-
ble of changing position at will, and any imperfection in the
moulds, or in their arrangement, will produce a correspond-
ing imperfection in the utterance.
In articulation as in morals, we have to answer for sins of
omission as well as of commission. Our articulation is faulty
not simply in the incorrect sounds we make, but also in the
correct sounds we too frequently suppress. The ear should
be trained to distinguish the finer shades of difference in
sounds, and the organs of speech should be carefully and
persistently drilled until they are able to produce, promptly
and with ease, all the sounds of the language, in all their
varied and complex combinations. It is believed that a care-
ful study and practice of the exercises here given will accom-
plish that result.
As to the importance of Articulation, there can be but one
opinion. The distinctness and polish which it gives to speech
are quickly recognized, even by those whose usage is a sad
reflection upon that importance.


## p. 70 (#72) ##############################################

70
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
In the strict sense of the term, Articulation would be
regarded as a division or department of Pronunciation; but
for convenience it will here be given a broader signification,
and be made to include some exercises in Pronunciation.
66
The question is frequently asked, What is the standard of
pronunciation ? Dr. Worcester says, The pronunciation
of the English language, like that of all living languages,
is in a great measure arbitrary. It is exposed to the caprices
of fashion and taste. It is liable to change from one age to
another; and it varies, more or less, not only in the different
and distantly separated countries in which it is spoken, but
also in the different divisions and districts of the same coun-
try. No two speakers or orthoepists, though inhabitants of
the same place, would be likely to agree in the pronuncia-
tion of all its words. The standard of pronunciation is not
the authority of any dictionary, or of any orthcepist; but it
is the present usage of literary and well-bred society." He
then proceeds to show that the usage of the best society in
London is entitled to far more consideration than that of
any other city, but adds, in the next sentence, that the usage
of the best society in the place or district in which one resides
is not to be disregarded. While the latter suggestion might
prove a convenience to many, it must be accepted with great
caution. There are many districts in this country, as well as
in England, which can scarcely boast of much "best society."
Even in places claiming men eminent in many departments
of learning, the utter recklessness and disregard of the prop-
er forms of spoken language which so generally prevail,
would render the pronunciation of such men wholly unwor-
thy as models. Not long since, a student remarked, in
justification of his pronunciation, "Our pastor pronounces
c-a-l m, căm, and he is a very intelligent man." The argu-
ment is a very common, though not a very safe, one.
With all due deference to Dr. Worcester's remark that the
. authority of any dictionary is not the standard of pro-
nunciation, we believe that very few persons in America,


## p. 71 (#73) ##############################################

ARTICULATION.
search beyond Webster and Worcester for their models. It
is the business of the dictionary to present the best usage of
the best society, whether it be that of London, Boston, or any
other city. The revisions of the dictionary should and do
keep pace with the progress and changes of language.
While some person must be first, and some other person
last, in this process of change, yet Pope's rule in regard to
new words may be fitly applied here:
In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold ;
Alike fantastic, if too new or old;
Be not the first by whom the new are tried,
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.
The question is frequently asked, Which is preferred,
Webster or Worcester? Much has been written, and a great
deal of time wasted in the attempt to prove the superiority
of one to the other. The extent to which Webster is used is
the very strongest indorsement in itself; and when, with
that, we couple the testimony of the best scholars in this
country and in England, it seems like pedantry or bigotry
to say he is unworthy of recognition as a standard. The
extent to which Worcester is used is also the very strongest
indorsement; and when we find him to be approved by men
equally renowned, we must recognize him as equally high
authority. The truth is, they differ less widely than many
persons suppose; and when they differ, we have the advan-
tage of a choice of pronunciation. When Webster says
eglantine or eglantine, and Worcester says eglantine or
eglantine, they agree, not only in recognizing the two forms,
but also in showing their preference for the first. If our
respect for their common preference be our controlling
motive, we will pronounce the word eglantine. But if our
pastor, or our doctor, or the judge of our county court, or
the "best society" in which we move, uses the second form,
and our desire to conform to such usage is greater than our
respect for the joint preference of Webster and Worcester,
we have the fullest freedom to use the second form.


## p. 72 (#74) ##############################################

72
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
When these lexicographers give two forms each of pro-
nouncing the same word, they frequently reverse the order,
thus differing in their preference, and, it is to be hoped, for
other reasons than to differ. When Webster says sliver or
sliver, and Worcester says sliver or sliver, we may have one of
several motives to govern our choice. We may take the
preferred form of our preferred authority; we may be gov-
erned by home usage or our best society; or we may call in
Smart or some other eminent English orthoepist to act as
umpire.
When Webster gives two forms and Worcester gives but
one, or vice versa, if the one form agrees with either of the
two forms of the other authority, as in most instances it will,
the.. the weight of authority would seem to be in favor of the
form which they give in common. Yet if home usage is in
harmony with the other form, that usage may assert its privi-
lege even to the exclusion of the other authority. If Webster
says vase (pronounced vace) and Worcester says vase (pro-
nounced vaze) or vase, the weight of authority seems to be in
favor of vase (pronounced vace) yet home usage, or a third
orthoepist, may decide otherwise.
If Webster says cèm'-ent or ce-ment', and Worcester says
cèm'-ent, the case is clearer, for Worcester's only form agrees
with Webster's preferred form; yet even here, home usage,
or a third orthoepist, or both combined, may decide in favor
of ce-ment'. When Webster says somber and Worcester
sombre, we are compelled to make a choice, and will make it,
doubtless, by some of the methods already suggested.
Most persons use but one dictionary, and will, therefore,
follow the dictum of that one, but in these days of cheap
books and close attention to forms of pronunciation, it would
be well to have not only a quarto edition of one of our stand-
ard lexicographers, but also one of the better abridged
editions of the other. This is necessary, not so much to
assure ourselves that we are right, for we may be right by
the use of one dictionary, but rather to be assured that our
neighbor is not wrong. In our study of pronunciation,

7
instead of trying to be strictly in harmony with one of the
recognized authorities, and ignoring the other, we should
aim, rather, to be not opposed to both. The reader will
observe that in this discussion, we have had reference sim-
ply to Pronunciation.
The change from an old form of pronunciation to a
new one is always attended with discomfort for a while. It
is like donning a new hat or wearing a pair of shoes for the
first time. We feel ill at ease, and imagine everybody recog-
nizes our discomposure. But the new form, by constant
use, grows to fit the mouth, as the new shoes become easy
to the feet. To one who has pronounced c-a-l-f, kăƒ, for
many years, the change to käƒ may make him feel not unlike
that animal for a time, but a knowledge of the fact that the
latter form alone is right should stimulate him to overcome
all opposing difficulties. The first thing necessary is the
acquaintance of the ear and its acceptance of the new form;
for the ear, like timid children, will not receive a stranger
willingly. Many repetitions of the new form aloud, will
beget ease in its utterance, and accustom the ear to its sound,
and after much private practice of this kind, the learner
need not hesitate to use it in conversation or reading. Con-
fidence is victory; timidity defeat. If the student will make
it a habit to consult the dictionary whenever he hears a form
of pronunciation unlike his own, and make a careful list of
the words in which his usage is incorrect, and correct those
words in the manner suggested above, he will find his ear
and his tongue keeping pace in the new work, the former
acquiring the power to discriminate very closely, and the
latter the power to make the finer distinctions with ease, so
that that which at first may be a task, will grow to be a
source of never-failing delight.

EXERCISES IN ARTICULATION,
With Suggestions to Teachers and Students.
The following exercises were arranged several years ago,
for use in the classes of the National School of Elocution and
Oratory, with no thought of their appearance in a book.
The matter was gathered from various sources, some of it
being used without change, while much of it has been given
new shape and adapted more fully to our purpose. The old
and the new have been so thoroughly mingled, that to-day it
would be difficult to make acknowledgment where acknowl-
edgment might be due. When every claim has been satisfied,
it is believed enough will still remain to commend the ex-
ercises to all who aspire after correct and distinct enuncia-
tion.
To some, the arrangement may seem illogical and the
exercises disjointed, but it must be remembered that this
does not aim to be a systematic treatise upon the theory of
articulation, but rather a series of practical and progress-
ive exercises, designed to promote good articulation. These
exercises have been thoroughly tested in the class-room and
their value fully established.
A thorough acquaintance with the elementary sounds of
the language lies at the foundation of good articulation.
Instead of presenting the table of elements at the outset,
experience has shown that it is better to lead the student to
that closer discrimination which the table involves, by a
careful system of spelling exercises. This inductive method
greatly simplifies the task by showing the student that the
analysis or spelling is nothing more than simply separating
the sounds, which, in combination he has long been accus-
tomed to use.

The division into lessons, here indicated, is not essential,
being a mere matter of convenience in our classes as adapt.
ed to the length of the recitations.
m
TO THE TEACHER.-In the spelling exercises, have the class pronounce the
word mat in a firm conversational tone. Then, prolong the word several
seconds, being careful to distribute the time as equally as possible upon the
several sounds. The t sound cannot be much prolonged, but it should be made
sharp and clear. The m should be as long as the a. This will set out the several
sounds in the word conspicuously, and prepare the student for the third step,
which is the analysis. In the prolonged form it is well to use the monotone so
that the slide or inflection may not call the attention away from the final
sound. When the word has been thus pronounced, have the class reproduce
the first sound alone, then the second, then the third. If the first be given
correctly and the second incorrectly, set aside the m sound, and have them re-
peat what remains of the word (at), listening closely for the first sound w
made. Proceeding slowly and carefully in this way, the student will so n
come to enjoy what will be to him the discovery of a new power. Insist upon
his ignoring the letters, and have him depend entirely upon the sound. For
this purpose the teacher should pronounce the words of the first lesson without
the students having seen them previously, or even seeing them at the time of
spelling. The simplest words have been selected, and some of the sounds are
frequently repeated so as to make the task as light as possible. The five steps
in the process of phonic analysis are as follows: 1st. Teacher pronounc, the
word in a firm, natural tone. 2d. Class pronounce the word in the same tone
as nearly as possible. 3d. Class prolong the word. 4th. Class utter the separate
sounds of the word. 5th. Class pronounce the word in a simple, natural man-
ner. The word having been pronounced by the teacher, the work of the clasa
may be suggested to the eye by the following arrangement:

The last step is designed to give greater completeness to the process of analy
sis. Without it, the work would seem unfinished. If the pupils have mu

prolonging it, have them repeat the process a number of times, enlarging
slightly at first and increasing in length each time until the several sounds
hang together by so feeble a thread that they may be readily separated. This
may be represented thus:
Class:

The exercises may be nicely varied, and with great interest and profit too, by
the employment of the synthetic method, the teacher giving the several sounds
of a word widely separated, and requiring the class to put them more and more
closely, until they combine to form the word. This process may be represented
to the eye by reversing the above arrangement, thus:
Teacher:

individual members of the class.

purpose. By a gradual inductive process we pass from simple monosyllables
containing the long and short vowel sounds to those sounds as individual ele-
ments. We also lay a basis for a series of exercises continued through a num-
ber of lessons, the advantage of which exercises will become more apparent as
we proceed. Be careful to have the class give the short vowel sounds correctly;
the long vowel sounds will present but little difficulty.

III.
TO THE TEACHER.-The sounds of b, d, g, w and y are generally regarded
difficult by beginners. The prolonged form of the consonant, suggested in the
first exercise, will render them easy of acquisition. By g is meant the hard
sound, as in go, not as in gem. The sound of wu is equivalent to woo; and the
sound of yoo, to yu. In the second exercise be very careful that the short vow-
els are made correctly. The third exercise is designed to give vigor and
flexibility to the muscles of the mouth. In the fourth exercise, begin slowly
and carefully, and increase to a rapid utterance. Make no pause between the
words of a line, and only a slight pause at the end of the line. In the fifth ex-
ercise, have the class give separately and vigorously the sounds represented by
the letters in Italics, then the combination as a whole, after which, bring out
the combination prominently in the words that follow. The letters of the
Italic combiration are not always the same as those representing the combina-
tion in the word, but the sounds are the same, and the Italics are the better
representatives of the sounds.

IV.
TO THE TEACHER.-It is desirable that the table of elementary sounds, with
their key words, be committed to memory. This need not be accomplished in
one lesson, nor in five, but should be kept in mind, so that with a little special
study, together with the reviews hereafter to be given, the work will be
achieved without much effort. For the convenience of the student the nota-
tion of Webster and of Worcester is presented in its application to the voice
sounds. For the purpose of drill, have the class pronounce firmly each key
word under Voice Sounds twice, then utter the sound of the vowel twice. After
the entire list has been disposed of in this manner, repeat the list, giving the
key word once and the sound twice. Repeat, giving the vowel sounds only, but
uttering each twice. Proceed in like manner with the Breath and Union
Sounds. The distinguishing character of the vowel sounds in the coalescents
or inseparables-ar, er, or, and ur-depends entirely upon the r. Although the
vowel sounds may be given alone, or may even be combined with other sounds
than r, yet the fact remains that in English words those vowel sounds are in-
separably combined with r. For this reason it is suggested that the two sounds
be joined and considered as one, just as the diphthongs oi and ou are regarded
as single, though not simple sounds. For the convenience of the student the
names of the diacritical marks or symbols are given.
1. The elementary sounds are classified according to the
material of which they are made.
Voice Sounds are those which are made of voice.
Breath Sounds are those which are made of breath.
Union Sounds are those which unite voice and breath in
one element.

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
PRACTICAL HINTS UPON A FEW VOICE SOUNDS.
TO THE TEACHER.-Careful and frequent practice upon the words given as
examples and as exercises in this lesson will be profitable. The student should
be urged to increase the list of examples under each of the sections, as ex-
amples are furnished in his conversation and reading, especially adding those
in which his usage is faulty.
1. Italian a (Ä) when not followed by r is frequently mis-
pronounced. Examples-balm, calm, palm, psalm, calf,
half, ha, wrath, aunt, laugh, launch, mustache.
quaff
staff
abaft
aft
after
craft
draft
2. Fifth a (A or A) occurs chiefly in monosyllables ending
in ff, ft, ss, st, sk, sp, nce, nt. The following list, with their
derivatives, will furnish abundant practice :-
-
graft
haft
raft
rafter
V.

hasp
enhance
glance
lance
prance
trance
ant
chant
rasp grant
advance pant
answer slant
chance
blanch
dance branch
3. Short o (ŏ) is often incorrectly sounded like broad a
(A or A). Examples-on, gone, dog, off, often, soft, soften,
long, prong, song, strong, thong, throng.


## p. 83 (#85) ##############################################

ARTICULATION-PHONICS.
83
4. Long u (u) is often incorrectly sounded like long oo
(50 or ô) when preceded by d, g, j, l, n, s, t, ch, th, wh, z.
Examples-dubious, duty, duke, duet, dew, due, duel, dupe,
gewgaw, gubernatorial, June, juice, jubilant, jubilee, junior,
juniper, jurist, lute, Lucifer, lunacy, lurid, lucid, lucre, lumin-
ous, new, neuter, nucleus, nuisance, numeral, nutriment,
suit, suitor, suet, sue, sudorific, suicide, superintend, tune,
tube, tunic, Tuesday, tureen, tulip, tumult, chew, chusite,
thews, whew, whewer, zuche, azumea.
5. After r, sh, and w, long u (ū) represents the sound of
long oo (00). Examples-rude, brute, fruit, shude, shute,
sure, issue.
6. The coalescent ar (â or ▲ with r), as in pare, should not
bend too much toward long a (A), as in payer, nor yet to-
ward short a (Ă), as in parry.
7. The coalescent er (Ẽ with r) should be carefully distin-
guished from ur ( or ₺ with r). Exercise-yes, sir; no, sir;
prefer, verge, verse, mercy, ermine,—fir, fur; earn, urn; bird,
burred; serge, surge.
8. The vowel in the coalescent or is more open than long
o (ō), but not so open as broad a (ṣ or â). Examples-for,
more, corn, borne, lord, stork, pour, George, board, mourn,
door. But when or occurs in an accented syllable, followed
by a vowel, or by another r, in a word not a derivative, it has
its regular short sound (ŏ). Examples-foreign, orange, tor-
rid, coronet, coral, correlate, corridor.
9. The coalescent ur occurs in monosyllables when not
followed by a vowel; in accented syllables with r final, or r
followed by one or more consonants different from itself;
and in derivatives from either of those classes. Examples-
cur, fur, furl, hurt, burst, purr,-recur, curfew, furlong, dis-
bursed,-currish, furry, purring, recurring. This sound
should be carefully distinguished from short u (u) before
r in such words as curry, hurry, burrow, currant, current.

VI.
TO THE TEACHER.-The long and short vowel sounds are designed to be used
in the second section of this lesson as in the third section of lesson III. The
third section of this lesson has been explained under the fifth section of lesson
III, and the fourth section under the first section of lesson I. As few persons
pronounce all of the words of the fifth section of this lesson correctly, it should
be practiced with great care.

TO THE TEACHER.-Cognates are sounds requiring the same position of the
vocal organs. The first of each pair is a Breath Sound, the second a Union
Sound. The distinction should be carefully marked.
The Contrasts require great precision in their utterance. Careless speakers

ARTICULATION-SEAT OF THE ACCENT.
89
X.
TO THE TEACHER.-The rules of this lesson are too general, and the excep
tions too numerous, to make the rules of much practical benefit, other than to
show general tendencics of the language. The chief value of this lesson will
consist in the frequent practice of the correct pronunciation of these and other
words which teachers and students will meet with in the course of their read-
ing, and which fall under the several rules and exceptions here given. This
practice will make the correct pronunciation of the words familiar, and it is the
only truly practical method.
SEAT OF THE ACCENT.
1. A syllable is a word or part of a word uttered with a
single impulse of the voice.
2. A word of one syllable is called a monosyllable; of two,
a dissyllable; of three, a trisyllable; of more than three, a
polysyllable.
3. The last syllable of a word is called the ultimate; the
next to the last is called the penult; the third from the last,
the antepenult; the fourth from the last, the pre-antepenult.
4. Of words of two syllables, nouns and adjectives gener-
ally have the accent on the first syllable, and verbs on the
second syllable. Examples: Nouns-abbot, comet, fossil,
napkin, album, comma, antic, gallon, anvil, atom, linnet,
garret, logic, basket, demon, organ, genus, bobbin. Adjec-
tives—common, naval, lucid, dental, lurid, candid, dulcet,
horrid, carnal, quiet, rabid, mental, rancid. Verbs-admit,
affix, occur, impel, forbid, annex, commit, expel, concur,
debar, excel, emit, dispel, demur, ferment, purloin.
So general is this law that the exceptions often lead us
into error. Examples: Nouns-morass, recess, research,
resource, romance, address, adept, adult, ally, allies, basalt,
compeer, contour, finance, vendue, routine, recourse. Ad-
jectives-canine, condign, robust, verbose, occult, prolix.
Verbs-harass, ransack, gyrate, sojourn, preface, purport,
comment.
Some nouns and adjectives are distinguished from verbs of

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.)
the same spelling by this difference of accent; as-accent,
conduct, contract, insult, torment, concert, convict, escort,
import, export, object, record, subject, abstract, conflict,
protest, compound, desert, progress, project, retail, contrast,
contest, confine, quarantine,-absent, frequent.
5. Words of more than two syllables generally have the
primary accent on the antepenult. Walker calls this the
favorite accent of the language. Examples-disputant,
hospital, industry, domicile, juvenile, crystalline, serpentine,
coralline, centrifugal, interpolate, misanthropy, chalybeate,
heliacal, chimerical, chirography, anachronism, simulta
neous, ammoniacal, reciprocity, demoniacal, interlocutor,
homœopathy, hypochondria, idiosyncrasy, dicotyledonous,
trigonometrical, impracticability, monocotyledonous, valetu-
dinarian, incommensurability, unintelligibility.
Exceptions to this law often lead us into error, as—manu-
mit, magazine, acclimate, defalcate, inundate, exculpate,
exponent, condolence, opponent, hospitable, prebendary,
formidable, cotyledon, conservator, explicable, contumely,
despicable, nomenclature, orthoepy, orthoepist, peremptory,
exemplary, obligatory, indisputable, indissolubly.
6. English derivatives, or words derived from other words
in the language, generally retain the accent of their primi-
tives, as-mischievous, mountainous, serviceable, unhappi-
ness, admiralty, fragmentary.
Exceptions to this law frequently lead us astray, as-
chastisement, comparable, disputable, lamentable, impiously,
irreparable.
7. Many words from the Latin and Greek, introduced
into our language with little or no change of orthography,
retain the classical accent. The attempt to make such
words conform to English analogy frequently leads us into
Examples-acumen, bitumen, horizon, paragoge,
abdomen, lyceum, museum, sonorous, decorum, mausoleum.
error.
8. In many words of very common usage, this analogy of
the English prevails over the classical accent, as—auditor,
orator, minister, senator, plethora.


## p. 91 (#93) ##############################################

ARTICULATION-PREFIXES.
91
9. Many words derived without change of orthography
from the French, are accented on the last syllable. Ex-
a:nples—antique, bastile, bourgeois, chateau, corvette, finesse,
giraffe, adieu, artiste, bouquet, coquette, début, canaille,
canard, blanc-mange, carte-blanche, depot, débris, eclat,
encore, ennui, élite, entrée, facade, machine, mêlée, mirage,
monsieur, parquet, parole, parterre, penchant, physique,
plateau, régie, soirée, sortie, surtout, sang-froid, savant,
souvenir, tableau, tirade, vignette, vedette, vendue, amateur,
bagatelle, coterie, connoisseur, chevalier, cuirassier, debau-
chee, debonair, dishabille, exposé, mademoiselle, millionaire,
nonchalance, protégé, reservoir, repertoire, recherché, sobri-
quet, solitaire, têtè-a-tête, vis-à-vis.
10. When two words are used antithetically which differ
only or chiefly in one of their syllables, the primary accent
is transferred to that syllable; as, He must increase but I
must decrease. Did you say a new addition, or a new
edition? Our sins of omission as well as of commission,
she suspect him or expect him?
Did
In counting we say thir'teen, four teen, fif'teen, &c., but in
answer to a question, as, "How many dollars did you pay for
your coat," we should answer, "Fifteen'." When emphatic,
the accent is quite evenly divided; as, "They ate fourteen
large oysters for supper."
XI.
PREFIXES.
TO THE TEACHER.-The term "Prefixes," at the head of this lesson, is used
in its broader sense, and is made to apply to the beginning of a word, to that
part which is "fixed before," whether the word be a primitive or a derivative.
1. The letter a, as a prefix, when not accented, is sounded
like Italian ä, slightly obscured. The sound of long a in such


## p. 92 (#94) ##############################################

92
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
position, should be carefully avoided. Examples :—again.
against, abaft, abash, abate, acute, adopt, alarm.
At the end of a word or of a syllable, a, when unaccented,
generally takes the same sound; as, Cuba, America, algebra,
sofa, idea,—banana, cabal, caboose, canal, canary.
2. When bi and tri are used as prefixes, the i is usually
long. Examples:-bicrenate, biennial, biflorous, biforate,
bilingual, bimana, binary, binervate, binomial, biography,
biology, bipedal, bisect, bivalvous, triad, trialogue, tribunal,

ARTICULATION-UNACCENTED VOWELS.
97
XIII.
UNACCENTED VOWELS.
No one need hope to have an elegant pronunciation
without attention to the vowels in unaccented syllables, yet
the dictionaries leave those vowels unmarked except in a
few first syllables. Unfortunately, too few persons, even
among students of Elocution, study with care the "Principles
of Pronunciation" contained in the first part of the larger
dictionaries.
Webster says, "When an unaccented syllable ends in a
consonant, its vowel, if single, has in strict theory, its
regular short or shut sound, though uttered somewhat more
faintly, or with a less proportionate force, than in an accent-
ed syllable, as in as-sign', con'-duct, con'-flict, &c. In many
words of this class, however, the vowel is apt to suffer a
change of its distinctive quality, passing over into some sound
of easier utterance." The sound of u in urn, often called the
'natural vowel,' and that of short u, are the vowel sounds of
easiest utterance, and the sounds toward which many of the
others tend when rendered obscure; as, dollar, nectar, altar,
alter, feather, nadir, tapir, zephyr, actor, mirror,―idea, sofa,
ballad, ballast, potato, window, orphan, dismal, compass,
parable, culpable, enemy, strategy, charity, possible, cuticle,
crucible, parody, analogy, calculate, masculine, analysis. To
pronounce these with a broad ur or uh sound, as: nectur,
actur, ballud, puhtatuh, dismul, enuhmy, charuhty, analuhsis,
&c., is a fault which all chaste speakers carefully avoid.
The following general principles may aid the student, but
they are too broad to be wholly relied upon :
1. Long a, long and short e, tend toward short i.
2. Short a, Italian a, intermediate a, long and short o,
tend toward short u.


## p. 98 (#100) #############################################

98
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
3. Coalescents ar, er, or, and Italian a followed by r, tend
toward ur.
4. Long oo tends toward short oo.
Some of these tendencies are very slight, and others are
very marked. The degree of each it is impossible to specify;
it can be learned only by hearing correct articulation. To
some of those tendencies there seem to be exceptions, and
this serves to increase the difficulty. The following exam-
ples will be of advantage:
A, verging toward .-Monday, Tuesday, mountain, certain,
village, cabbage, orange. But in 'chocolate,' 'delicate,' 'intri-
cate,' 'ultimate,' we have exceptions, the a verging rather
toward short e. The same is true in 'miscellany,' 'moment-
ary,' and other words of similar termination. In verbs end-
ing in ate the long a sound is usually retained.
ē, verging toward .-Genesis, remorse, elegant, society,
enemy, coffee, college. The e in society, enemy, elegy, &c.,
is sometimes corrupted into short u.
ě, verging toward .-Wicked, basket, riches. Here the
proper bending is exceedingly slight. In some words, as
poem, solemn, emblem, the e is frequently corrupted into
short u.
ǎ, verging toward u.-Palpable, culpable, mental, ballad
cavalcade.
ä, verging toward u.-Cuba, sofa, comma, idea.
å, verging toward й.—Douglass, compass, cutlass, breakfast,
distance, gallant.
ō, verging toward .-Polite, pomade, potato, tobacco.
Ŏ, verging toward .-Commerce, companion, compel,
pivot, fagot, mammoth.
Coalescent ar, verging toward ur.-Parental, thereat, thereon,
preparation.
Coalescent er, verging toward ur.-Exasperate, assertion,
conversation, perdition.
Coalescent or, verging toward ur.—Camphor, languor, actor,
tenor, victor, captor, reformation.

Italian a followed by r, verging toward ur.-Dollar, altar,
nectar, barbarous.
oo, verging toward oo.-To-day, to-morrow, together, erudi-
tion.
Worcester marks vowels in unaccented syllables with a
period or dot underneath; Webster leaves them unmarked.
It must be observed that Worcester employs this character
to indicate a slight stress of voice, and not to note any par-
ticular quality of sound, as will be seen in the follow-
ing examples, in which the italicized vowels are thus
marked: liar, palace, abbacy—brier, fuel—elixir, ruin—actor,
confess-truly, martyr.

1. The letter b following m in the same syilable, is gen-
erally silent, as in lamb, limb, numb, tomb, &c., but in
rhomb and succumb, it is retained.
2. The sound of sh is often incorrectly made like zh in
such words as Asia, Asiatic, nausea, nauseous, Persia,
Persian.
3. The sound of t in the termination tle following 8 is gen-
erally suppressed; as, apostle, epistle, thistle, whistle, bustle,
hustle, castle, jostle.
4. Care should be taken to preserve the aspirate or
breath sound of th in the plurals truths, youths, breaths. In
the plurals baths, laths, paths, moths, cloths, oaths, mouths,
sheaths, swaths, wreaths, the th is vocal. It is also vocal in
booth and booths, but aspirate in withe and withes.
In the adjective forms, as, blithe, lithe, and in the verb
forms bathe, clothe, mouth, sheathe, wreathe, &c., the th is
Vocal.

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
5. The letter a when used as an article is always given its
long or name sound when emphatic. When unemphatic it
becomes obscure Italian a, even verging toward short u when
rendered very lightly.
6. The article the, when emphatic, is pronounced with e
long. When unemphatic before a vowel the e verges toward
short i. Before a consonant sound, it passes through all the
degrees of change from long e to obscure short u, according
to the degree of emphasis.
7. The vowel of the pronoun my, when quite unemphatic,
may take the sound of short i. In forms of address, so fre-
quently used by English dramatists, the short i is preferred;
as, "My lord, the queen would speak with you, and pres-
ently."
8. The sound of s when followed by that of long u, or the
pronoun you, is often incorrectly changed to sh. The sound
of z followed by that of sh is, in like manner, changed to zh.
The following examples may serve to illustrate these two
faults: 'God bless you,' 'We shall miss you,' 'He will pass
Utica,''
,''As sure as you go,' 'I was sure he would come.'
9. While care should be taken not to drop the d of the
conjunction and, yet to sound it fully, in every instance,
as some authors would have us do, would be the veriest
pedantry. In uttering the word, the organs pass from the
n position into that of d, but the power given to the latter
sound depends greatly npon the first sound of the next
word. To finish the d perfectly would be not only to mar
the fluency of speech, but also to break the magnetic chain
of thought.
10. With all the irregularities of our language, it is not to
be wondered at that words are frequently mispronounced.
Many of the forms are so arbitrary, and the caprices of the
age so numerous, that few persons can claim to be above
criticism in the matter of pronunciation. And yet, whatever
apology or excuse for faults we may discover in this, we
should be more ready to apply such excuse to others' pro-
nunciation than to our own.

8. A day or two ago, during a lull in business, two little
boot-blacks, one white and one black, were standing at the
corners doing nothing, when the white boot-black agreed to
black the black boot-black's boots. The black boot-black
was of course willing to have his boots blacked by his fellow
boot-black, and the boot-black who had agreed to black the
black boot-black's boots went to work.
When the boot-black had blacked one of the black boot-
black's boots till it shone in a manner that would make any
boot-black proud, this boot-black who had agreed to black
the black boot-black's boots refused to black the other boot
of the black boot-black until the black boot-black, who had
consented to have the white boot-black black his boots,
should add five cents to the amount the white boot-black
had made blacking other men's boots. This the boot-black
whose boot had been blacked refused to do, saying it was
good enough for a black boot-black to have one boot blacked,
and he didn't care whether the boot that the white boot-
black hadn't blacked was blacked or not.
This made the boot-black who had blacked the black boot-
black's boot as angry as a boot-black often gets, and he
vented his black wrath by spitting upon the blacked boot
of the black boot-black. This roused the latent passions of
the black boot black, and he proceeded to boot the white
boot-black with the boot which the white boot-black had
blacked. A fight ensued, in which the white boot-black who
had refused to black the unblacked boot of the black boot-
black blacked the black boot-black's visionary organ, and
in which the black boot-black wore all the blacking off his
blacked boot in booting the white boot-black.

silently specifying: "Simon Short, Smithfield's sole surviv-
ing shoemaker. Shoes sewed and soled superfinely."
Simon's spry sedulous spouse, Sally Short, sewed shirts,
stitched sheets, and stuffed sofas. Simon's six stout sturdy
sons-Seth, Samuel, Stephen, Saul, Shadrach and Silas, sold
sundries. Sober Seth sold sugar, starch, spices; simple Sam
sold saddles, stirrups, screws; sagacious Stephen sold silks,
satins, shawls; skeptical Saul sold silver salvers, silver
spoons; selfish Shadrach sold shoe strings, soaps, saws,
skates; slack Silas sold Sally Short's stuffed sofas.
Some seven summers since, Simon's second son, Samuel,
saw Sophia Sophronia Spriggs somewhere. Sweet, sensible,
smart Sophia Sophronia Spriggs! Sam soon showed strange
symptoms. Sam seldom stayed at the store selling saddles, but
sighed sorrowfully, sought Sophia Sophronia's society, sang
several serenades slily. Simon stormed, scolded severely,
said Sam seemed so silly, singing such shameful, senseless
songs.
66
Strange Sam should slight such splendid summer sales,"
said Simon. "Strutting spendthrift! shatter-brained sim-
pleton!
"Softly, softly, sire" said Sally; "Sam's smitten-Sam's
spied a sweetheart.'
""
"Sentimental schoolboy!" snarled Simon; "Smitten ! Stop
such stuff!"
66
Simon sent Sally's snuff-box spinning, seized Sally's scis-
sors, smashed Sally's spectacles, and scattered several spools.
Sneaking scoundrel! Sam's shocking silliness shall sur-
cease!" Scowling Simon stopped speaking, starting swiftly
shopward. Sally sighed sadly. Summoning Sam she spoke
sweet sympathy.
66
Sam," said she, "sire seems singularly snappy: so, son,
stop strolling, stop smoking segars and spending specie super-
fluously; stop sprucing so; stop singing serenades,-stop
short: sell saddles, son; sell saddles sensibly; see Sophia
Sophronia Spriggs soon; she's sprightly, she's staple, so
solicit and secure Sophia speedily, Sam."
"So soon? so soon?" said Sam, standing stock still.
"So soon! surely," said Sally, smiling, "specially since sire
shows such spirit."
So Sam, somewhat scared, sauntered slowly, shaking stu-
pendously. Sam soliloquizes:
"Sophia Sophronia Spriggs Short-Sophia Sophronia
Short, Samuel Short's spouse-sounds splendid! Suppose
she should say-she sha'n't!"
Soon Sam spied Sophia starching shirts and singing softly.

'Sixty? sho!" said Sam. (Silence seventy-seven sec-

"See sister Susan's sunflowers," said Sophia, sociably scat-
tering such stiff silence.
66
Sophia's sprightly sauciness stimulated Sam strangely: so
Sam suddenly spoke sentimentally: "Sophia, Susan's sun-
flowers seem saying, "Samuel Short and Sophia Sophronia
Spriggs, stroll serenely and seek some sequestered spot, some
sylvan shade. Some sparkling spring shall sing soul-sooth-
ing strains; sweet songsters shall silence secret sighing;
super-angelic sylphs shall-""
Sophia snickered: so Sam stopped.
Sophia," said Sam, solemnly.
"Sam," said Sophia.
""
Sophia, stop smiling.
Sam Short's sincere. Sam's seek-
ing some sweet spouse, Sophia. Speak, Sophia, speak!
Such suspense speeds sorrow.'
Seek sire, Sam, seek sire."
So Sam sought sire Spriggs. Sire Sprigs said, "Sartin."
Seven short sabbaths later saw Sophia Sophronia Spriggs
the smiling spouse of Simon Short's son Samuel.

EXPRESSION.
True Expression consists in the most natural and effective
giving out of sentiment or emotion. It may be by form,
color, language, movement, or sound.
In Elocution, correct Expression relates to those adapta-
tions of the human voice necessary to convey the meaning
and spirit of the author. It involves proper use of all the
physical organs, but only becomes effective through the exer-
cise of the intellectual and emotional faculties. Appropriate
expression constitutes the soul power of spoken language.
The word signifies giving out, and therefore presupposes
something within. Hence it is of first importance to the Ex-
pression of a thought that the speaker have within him the
thought to be expressed.
To this end he should make a thorough analysis of the
language, and should answer for himself such questions as
the following: What is the prevailing thought in the pas-
sage? What are the subordinate thoughts, and how are
they related to the prevailing thought? Is any part of the
sentence merely incidental to the main sentence, and how
near or distant is the relation? What was the probable
state of the author's mind when he expressed the thought?
What were the circumstances which called it forth?
How should you feel, and how would you have expressed the
same sentiment, had the same circumstances moved you?
The mind will thus be led to a full and just comprehension of
the sentiment, and a sympathy will be awakened. A compre-
hension of the thought will render it intelligent in its expres
sion. Sympathy with the thought will give spirit to the ex-
pression. Let the student ever keep in mind that no skill of
112

EXPRESSION-MODULATION.
113
art can substitute for intelligence and spirit in oral expression.
It is, however, yet necessary that the utterance be under
such control that it may be made to harmonize with all
the infinite lights and shades of thought. True expression
should be carefully distinguished from mere fervor of spirit
and emotional violence. It is infinitely more than this; it is
spirit put under law. It is power under control. Herein con-
sists the art of adaptation. The three great essentials, then,
which every speaker should keep before him, are compre-
hension, sympathy, adaptation.
The changes of voice necessary to expression constitute
the modulations of speech.
MODULATION.
Modulation consists in the adaptation of speech to the
sentiment it is designed to convey. The various changes or
modulations are quality, pitch, force, time, and slides, or in-
flections.
QUALITY.
NOTE.-Quality concerns the kind of voice and its relation to the kind or
quality of sentiment. It has been fully treated as an element of vocal culture
in its proper place urder that heal, though its practical application, as an
element of expression, belongs to Modulation. For discussion and exercises, see
page 59.
PITCH.
Pitch relates to the High and Low of the voice.
NOTE.-Although the different degrees of Pitch are determined by the musical
scale, the changes are usually produced by side, while in music they are usually
produced by steps.
Pitch, like the other modulations, must be found in the'
sentiment. There is up and down in thought and feeling. “
Joy and victory are up. Melancholy and awe are down. To
respond to these qualities of sentiment, the sense must be
quick to perceive, and the voice must be capable of prompt
and graceful change, either by slide or step.


## p. 114 (#116) ############################################

111
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
The different degrees of Pitch are produced by the differ-
ent degrees of tension of the vocal cords.
Natural or unemotional sentiment will leave the vocal cords in
their most natural condition, and they will produce a natural
or medium tone.
Exaltation of spirit will cause a tension of the vocal cords,
and they will produce a correspondingly high tone.
Depression of spirit will cause the vocal cords to relax, and
the tone will be low.
There are, therefore, in Elocution, three natural divisions
of Pitch, Medium, High, and Low. From these, other divi-
sions may be made.
NOTE 1.-Each of these divisions must necessarily cover a range or variety of
sentiment. When the student is satisfied that the sentiment belongs to the
medium range, or the high or low range, he is likely to adapt the changes
within that range more gracefully and less mechanically than if he adapts his
Pitch too strictly to the musical scale. By the latter method he is liable to
speak by the musical tones rather than by the speaking tones.
NOTE 2.-The student should most carefully guard the quality of the tone in
the practice of the High and Low extremes.
LANGUAGE OF MEDIUM PITCH.-Unemotional language, such
as ordinary conversation, simple narration, and plain
description, and all language of natural full force, should be
expressed within the range of Medium Pitch.
LANGUAGE OF HIGH PITCH.-Passages of calling, command,
gayety, joy, victory, and extreme grief, are expressed within
the range of High Pitch.
LANGUAGE OF LOW PITCH.-Melancholy, reverence, awe,
despair, and language of the supernatural, are expressed
within the range of Low Pitch.

A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!

Through all our history to the last,
In the hour of darkness, and peril, and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

FORCE.
Force relates to the Loud and Soft of the voice.
The Force of speech must be regulated by the intensity of
the emotion which the sentiment inspires. We think and
feel with different degrees of intensity. We should speak
with corresponding degrees of Force.
The changes of Force are produced by the different degrees
of power with which the breath is applied upon the vocal
cords.
The student should not mistake mere noise or physical ex-
ertion for Force. True Force includes the idea of moral
power, and is often more manifest in a certain stateliness or
majesty of tone than in great exhibition of voice and man-
ner. It is the result of a uniform intensity of the whole
being, and of such a repose as will reflect reserve power,
which is, after all, the truest Force.
The student is especially cautioned against the substitution
of Pitch for Force. This is probably the most common error
known to public speakers. The moral force of a passage or a
discourse is often entirely neutralized by elevating the
Pitch. Changes of Force should be made without change of
Pitch unless the peculiar character of the thought requires
both.
Cultivation in Force follows the general principle laid
down by all true elocutionary training, that it begins with pure
conversation. The most natural Force is that which the culti-
vated voice takes most readily in conversational utterance. In
its relation to loud and soft it always approaches a medium be-
tween the two extremes, and is therefore most appropriately
called Medium Force. From this the student may readily
pass to the extremes of Full and Subdued.

LANGUAGE OF FULL FORCE.-Passages of defiance and
anger, bold, declamatory utterances, shouting, calling and

quict, pathos, melancholy, reverence and awe, should be

His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.

Sentiment has in it the quality of movement, and requires

the latter, slide skillfully, and use appropriate quality, who are
yet monotonous. owing to uniformity of Time. They move

the same degree of speed: or their individual words have
merely the Time necessary to their pronunciation, or the
pauses are measured, rather than adapted, or it may be that
in all of these conditions, the Time is set and formal, so
that the expression falls upon the ear with painful monotony.
Appropriate changes of Time also reflect self-control, show-
ing that slow or rapid utterance is not the result of tem-
perament, or of an excited condition of the speaker, but that
they are his servants, to be used according to his need.

2. A cannon which breaks its moorings becomes abruptly
some indescribable, supernatural beast. It is a machine
which transforms itself into a monster. This mass runs on
its wheels, like billiard-balls, inclines with the rolling,
plunges with the pitching, goes, comes, stops, seems to medi-
tate, resumes its course, shoots from one end of the ship to
the other like an arrow, whirls, steals away, evades, prances,
strikes, breaks, kills, exterminates.-Victor Hugo.
3. Never, never: Come away, away;
We'll burn his body in the holy place,
And with the brands fire the traitor's houses!
Take up the body.-Shakspeare.
I chatter, chatter, as I flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come, and men may go,
But I go on forever.-Tennyson.

1. And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is

And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow

And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on

2. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the

visitest him? For Thou hast made him a little lower than
the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy
hands: Thou hast put all things under his feet. Oh Lord,
our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth.

3. Hear the tolling of the bells-
Iron bells!

How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone.
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.-Poe.

4. The hours pass slowly by-nine, ten, eleven-how
solemnly the last stroke of the clock floats out upon the still

and seems to be caught up by spirit-voices of departed years,
until the air is filled with melancholy strains. It is the re-
quiem of the dying year.
Tenderly, mournfully it lingers upon the ear and sinks
into the heart; slowly and softly it dies away. The clock
strikes twelve; the grave opens and closes, and the old year
is buried.-Brooks.

TO THE TEACHER.-The above formula should be placed on the blackboard.
Announce a sentence,-for example: "O ye hard hearts! ye cruel men of
Rome!" and beginning with Medium Pi.ch, practice the student on the
Medium and the extremes until he can make the changes with promptness and
accuracy. Follow this with a similar exercise in Force and in Rate. When he
has mastered these changes in their individual application, the exercise may be
made more difficult by combining them according to the following:
ILLUSTRATION -Ask the class to utter the sentence, "O ye hard hearts, ve
cruel men of Rome!" in Medium Pitch, Medium Force, and Medium Time.
After proper explanation, point from one to another of the different degrees of
the different modulations. You may point to Full, under Force. The student
or class should give the sentence as before in Pitch and Rate, but change the
Force to Full. You may then point to Slow, under Rate. The class should

retain the Full Force as at the preceding exercise, also Medium Pitch, as it has
not yet been changed, but change the Rate to Slow. Those changes may be
continued indefinitely, and cannot fail to give flexibility to the voice, and the
capability of a ready adaptation in response to the changes of sentiment.
QUANTITY.
Quantity is time upon words.
""
66
Words stand for ideas, and according to the nature of the
idea to which the word refers, it is prolonged or shortened.
The word "long" should receive more length of time than
'short," though the latter contains more letters. Cut" and
"saw" should be pronounced according to the several ac-
tions they represent. Reversed in time, they will fail to
represent their respective meanings.
Appropriate Quantity contributes greatly to the relative
importance of the words in a sentence.
Quantity may be Medium, Long, or Short.
Words possessing no marked significance are uttered in
Medium Quantity.
Words of dignity and strength require Long Quantity.
Words of impatience, stubbornness, and of sudden action,
require Short Quantity.

and still as he refused it, the rabblement hooted, and clapped

PAUSE.
A pause is an interval of time between words.
There are two divisions of Pause, Grammatical and Rhe-
torical.
The Grammatical Pause is designed mainly as a guide to the
author's meaning, and the author's meaning should indicate
the character and length of the Pause.
The Rhetorical Pause marks the special separation of
words as reflected by the general thought of the author, but
which is not marked by the Grammatical Pause. The Rhe-
torical Pause gives a peculiar force to the words which precede
or follow it. It also indicates present action of the mind,
giving to speech the effect of freshness and originality. The
Rhetorical Pause is greatly varied in its application; and in
length, passes through every conceivable period of time,
from the almost spiritual separation of words, to that of a
short Grammatical Pause.

cal Pause.

EXPRESSION-EXAMPLES OF SLIDES.

SLIDES.
The Slide is a change of pitch upon a word.
Slides are upward and downward.
The Upward and Downward Slides may be united. They
then are known as the Wave or Circumflex.
The lights and shades of thought which cannot be ex-
pressed by the changes of Quality, Pitch, Force, or Time, are
gathered up by the slide, and the expression is rendered com-
plete.
The slides of the voice contribute, most of all the modu-
lations, to the accuracy of speech. The mind of the hearer is
turned from the general thought and conducted by the
Slide to the individual ideas which may enter into a sen-
tence.
The Slide also gives emphasis to the peculiar sentiment or
feeling which calls it forth. In view of its effect, therefore,
upon the accuracy and the emphasis of speech, the Slide may be
regarded as the crowning power of expression.
It is of constantly changing degree, according to the char-
acter or intensity of sentiment. Its simplest form is the
change of a single tone, and its most intense, that of the
octave or eight tones.
Slides are divided into conversational and emphatic.
The Conversational Slide is used in all the simplest forms
of speech. The changes of upward and downward are made
chiefly in reference to variety in the expression, one or the
other prevailing according as the sentiment tends to the
negative or positive form which will be shown to govern the
Emphatic Slide.
The Emphatic Slide is more significant, and the principles
governing its use are more closely defined. With reference
to the Emphatic Slide, all language may be divided into posi-
tive and negative.
Positive language comprises what is completed, definitely
stated or enjoined; and as that which is completed is laid
down, positive language takes the Downward Slide.


## p. 132 (#134) ############################################

132
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
Negative language comprises that which is subordinate,
incomplete and indefinite, and as that which is unfinished is
continued, or held up, negative language takes the Sustained
Voice or Rising Slide.
NOTE.-While the above is given as the most common governing principle of
the Slide, yet it should be observed that the Slide is greatly subject to the
demands of variety and melody, and to the connections of the thought in which
it is found; and is, therefore, less arbitrarily governed than the other modula-
tions.
The Wave or Circumflex is a Double Slide. Its simplest
use is in reflective pathos and solemnity. It is prominent in
wit and in language of double meaning, sarcasm, irony,
insinuation, and in surprise and astonishment.
The Rising Circumflex terminates on the upward slide.
The Falling Circumflex terminates on the downward slide.
The Circumflex is governed according to the general prin-
ciple governing the Emphatic Slide.

My

5. Once came to our fields a pair of birds that had never

6. Mountains are, to the rest of the body of the earth,
what violent muscular action is to the body of man. The
muscles and tendons of its anatomy are, in the mountain,
brought out with fierce and convulsive energy, full of
expression, passion, and strength; the plains and lower hills
are the repose and the effortless motion of the frame, when
its muscles lie dormant and concealed beneath the lines of
its beauty, yet ruling those lines in their every undulation.
This, then, is the first grand principle of the truth of the
earth. The spirit of the hills is action; that of the lowlands,
repose; and between these there is to be found every variety
of motion and of rest; from the inactive plain, sleeping like
the firmament, with cities for stars, to the fiery peaks,
which, with heaving bosoms and exulting limbs, with the
clouds drifting like hair from their bright foreheads, lift up
their Titan hands to heaven, saying, “I live forever!"

though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow
all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to
be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave
itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,
thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in
the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophe-
cies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall
cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when
that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall
be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I
understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I
became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see
through a glass darkly, but then face to face: now I know
in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known.

Gesture is posture or action, expressive of sentiment and
emotion. While Speech is the verbal manifestation of thought
and feeling, Gesture is the silent, but no less eloquent exposi-
tor of the same workings of the soul. It supplements
speech, and by its added grace, emphasis, and illustration,
furnishes to the hearer a picture complete in all its parts..
It is not the object to present here a series of rules upon
which the student is expected to rely. True art never
cables itself to mechanical forms-its inspiration and power
emanate from the soul of the speaker. There are, however,
certain natural laws which control all our actions, and upon
these are based the Topics presented in the following outline:

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
Gesture, with reference to sentiment, is divided into-
CONVERSATIONAL,
ORATORICAL,
DRAMATIC.
CONVERSATIONAL GESTURES are used in unemotional lan.
guage.
The position should be erect, easy and natural; the arm
movements should usually centre at the elbow, and the
expression of the countenance be open and cheerful.
ORATORICAL GESTURES delineate the earnest, the lofty, and
the sublime. Hence, the position is not only erect, but active;
the arm movements are mainly from the shoulder, and the
expression of the face is confident and animated.
DRAMATIC GESTURES relate to the drama and to all deeply
impassioned language. They are the exponent of the
passions, and require great intensity of feeling in position,
movement, and facial expression.
NOTE-Any one of the divisions above named may be found closely combined
with either, or both of the others, as shown in the following examples:
So through the night rode Paul Revere !
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm-
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore !
--Longfellow.
Then suddenly rang a sharp, low cry!
Bess sank on her knees, and wildly tossed
Her withered arms in the summer sky-
"O, Willie! Willie! my lad! my lost!
The Lord be praised! after sixty years

O, Willie darlin', were bitter tears!

POSITION:
By Position is meant the way in which a person stands in
speaking, whether it be in the parlor, the counting room, the
pulpit or at the bar. It is certain that curved spine, drooped
shoulders, protruded chin and bent knees are not only inele-
gant, but they, to a great degree, indicate mental or physical
weakness.
A healthful and graceful carriage demands that the head
be kept easily erect, the shoulders thrown sufficiently back to
give an open chest, and that the weight of the body rest upon
the supporting limb, the knee of the same kept firm. Care
should also be taken that the feet be properly placed. With-
out minute description, let it be observed that one foot be
placed in advance of the other, the heel of the advanced foot
pointing to the hollow of the retired one, the distance
between them depending upon the size and build of the
speaker. Greater freedom is thus given to the whole body
without a loss of its equilibrium.
Position may assume two forms-
First, the Passive Position, in which there is absence of
passion. This is the most common attitude of the speaker,
and sustains to Gesture the same relation as Pure Quality
of voice to Conversation.
Second, the Active Position, which represents intensity of
thought and feeling. The head is more firmly set, the chest
more expanded, the lower limbs are more decided and the
Advanced and Retired Postures strongly marked, often to
such a degree that the unsupporting limb may be thrown
upon the toes.
The Passive Position is in harmony with unemotional
language whether it be ordinary conversation, didactic ex-
pression, or plain argument.

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
Examples for practice-
1. It is better to inspire the heart with a noble sentiment
than to teach the mind a truth of science.-Edward Brooks.
2. The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the
year,
Of wailing winds and naked woods and meadows brown
and sere;
Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the autumn leaves
lie dead;
They rustle to the eddying gust and to the rabbit's
tread;
The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrubs
the jay,
And from the wood-top calls the crow through all the
gloomy day.-Bryant, "Death of the Flowers."
›
The Active Position may represent earnest, enthusiastic
bold or impassioned speech, in which case the weight of the
body is thrown upon the advanced limb. It may represent
that which is decided, determined, resistent or independent,
in which case the weight of the body is thrown upon the
retired limb.
Examples of Active-Advanced-
1. Gray nose to gray nose, and each steady mustang,
Stretched neck and stretched nerve till the arid earth
rang.-Joaquin Miller, “Kit Carson's Ride.'
2. Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forwar
let us range!
Let the great world spin forever down the ringing
grooves of change!
Through the shadow of the globe we sweep into the
younger day;
Beer fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.
-Tennyson, "Locksley Hall."
3. "O comrades! warriors! Thracians! if we must fight,
let us fight for ourselves; if we must slaughter, let us slaugh-
ter our oppressors; if we must die, let us die under the oper.

Kellogg.

Examples of Active-Retired—
1. Come with bayonets in your hands instead of petitions
-surround the White House with your legions-I am ready
for you all!-George Lippard, "Andrew Jackson."
Talk not to me
Of odds or match! When Comyn died,
Three daggers clashed within his side!
Talk not to me of sheltering hall!
The Church of God saw Comyn fall!
On God's own altar streamed his blood;
While o'er my prostrate kinsman stood
The ruthless murderer, even as now,-
With armed hand and scornful brow.
-Sir Walter Scott, "Lord of the Isles."
3. "What! to attribute the sacred sanctions of God and
Nature, to the massacres of the Indian scalping-knife! to the
cannibal savage, torturing, murdering, devouring, drinking
the blood of his mangled victims! Such notions shock every
precept of morality, every feeling of humanity, every senti-
ment of honor. These abominable principles, and this more
abominable avowal of them, demand the most decisive in-
dignation."-From Chatham's Rebuke of Lord Suffolk.
NOTE.-The principles above presented are not designed to cover the entire
ground of Position. Enough has been stated to give a general idea of the sub-
ject; other attitudes, largely under characterization, must be left to the
taste and judgment of the speaker.
MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY.
Movements of the Body are those of the Head, the Arm,
and the Lower Limbs. These movements should be free,
natural and significant.
HEAD.
The head movements should not only be varied in harmony
!

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
with the sentiment, but they should also be directed to the
individual hearers throughout the audience. This will show
that the words are not meant for the separate few, but are
designed for every one in the assemblage.
On the other hand, the speaker should carefully guard
against too frequent change of this important member.
Nothing is more unpleasant than a constant or habitual
movement of the head.
ARM.
PURPOSE.-The movements of the arm are for the purpose
of giving clearer meaning or greater stress to a word or an
expression than can be given by voice only. This purpose
may be shown in three ways:
First. In the location of an object, thus bringing it more
vividly before the mind of the auditor-hence Gestures of
Location.
Second. To describe or show how or in what way some-
thing appeared or was affected or imitated-hence Gestures
of Illustration.
Third. To give greater intensity to words by the degree
of force culminating the movement-hence Gestures of
Emphasis.
NOTE 1.-Gestures of Location and Illustration present themselves readily in
a'l kinds of language-the student must, however, guard against making more
than are either necessary or true.
NOTE 2.-Emphatic Gestures are less readily discovered, and are for this
reason less liable to extremes in manner. The best means of ascertaining the
place of the Emphatic Gesture is to thoroughly comprehend the meaning of
the passage to be rendered, giving to the most vital part of it the needed gesture.
NOTE 3.-By the classification just made it must not be understood that the
three forms of Gesture always exist separately; they are sometimes combined—
this is especially true of the Emphatic Gesture, which frequently blends with
one of the others.

Location-
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
Far aloft in that high steeple
Sat the bell-man, old and gray.
-Independence Bell.
Illustration-
There the troop of Minon wheels,
There the Northern horses thunder with the cannon at
their heels. Whittier: "Angels of Buena Vista.”
Straight the ancient Arrow-maker
Looked up gravely from his labor,
Laid aside the unfinished arrow,
Bade him enter at the doorway;
Saying, as he rose to meet him,
You are welcome, Hiawatha.
-Longfellow: "Song of Hiawatha."
She leans upon his neck
To watch the flowing darkness;
The bank is high and steep;
One pause-he staggers forward,
And unges in the deep
Adelaide Proctor: "Legend of Bregenz."
Emphasis-
The war is inevitable!
I tell you, though you, though all the world, though an
angel from Heaven should declare the truth of it, I would not
believe it.
LINES.-Movements of the Arm must be made in certain
lines. According to natural laws these lines are either
straight or curved-whether the assertion be conversational,
'oratorical or dramatic.
Guiding Principles: Forcible, determined, abrupt and
bold expressions require straight lines; such as are beautiful,


## p. 148 (#150) ############################################

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
graceful, genial, grave, grand and exultant require the
curves.
EXAMPLES.
Straight-
Down, soothless insulter! I trust not the tale.
-Campbell: "Lochiel's Warning."
Curved-
A lie which is all a lie, may be met and fought with outright;
But a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to fight.
-Tennyson: "The Grandmother."
The Niobe of nations! there she stands,
Childless and crownless in her voiceless woe!
-Byron : "Childe Harold."
One touch to her hand and one word in her ear,
When they reached the hall door where the charger stood
near.-Scott: Lochinvar."
66
It is further demonstrable by the same laws that these
lines must take a Middle, an Ascending, or a Descending
direction.
Such ideas as indicate ordinary events, plain statement
and description, emotional address or reference to substance,
real or imagined, surrounding, require a middle direction.
Reference to substance, real or imagined, located above;
pure, noble, lofty and exultant emotions, and all ideas
prompted by an approving conscience naturally require an
ascending direction.
Reference to substance, real or imagined, located below;
base, abject, grovelling emotions; frequently strong em-
phatic assertions, and all ideas prompted by a disapproving
conscience, naturally take a descending direction.
These general directions may carry the hand to the front,

the side, the back or points between, as may be shown by
the character of the assertion. Thus it will be seen that by
line and direction, the movements of the arm may be varied,
for the purpose of adding strength to uttered thought.
While a speaker is allowed the largest liberty in manner, so
long as he keeps within the limit of good taste, yet he who is
most natural, most artistic and most impressive, is the one who
evinces the clearest conception of what he wishes to convey;
and this must necessarily call out variety of motion. Gesture,
like speech, has in a sense, its modulations, and he who
conceives correctly will never be monotonous.
POSITION OF HAND.-Excepting the face, the hand con-
stitutes the strongest silent medium of communication,
and its interpretation almost exclusively depends upon the
position it assumes under different phases of expression.
Sheridan says: "Every one knows that with the hands we
can demand or promise, call, dismiss, threaten, supplicate,
ask, deny, show joy, sorrow, detestation, fear, confession,
penitence, admonition, respect, and many other things now
in common use." The positions of the haud are defined
by the common terms of Supine, Prone, and Vertical.
The Supine Position is extremely broad in its application.
It may be used in ordinary, beautiful and sublime descrip-
tion; in address to objects animate and inanimate; in com-
manding, entreating, welcoming, commending and kindred
ideas, and in elucidating or intensifying a statement or
argument.
The Hand Prone usually shows superposition or the resting
of one object, fact or principle upon another. It may also
denote destruction to life, morally or physically, and in a
certain sense, shows treachery or concealment.
The Hand Vertical indicates aversion or abhorrence of an
object which is distasteful, disgusting, or terrible; it is also
used in surprise, and to deprecate or deplore an unavoidable
circumstance or calamity.

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
DOUBLE GESTURES.
Double gestures have the same general meaning as the
single ones. Their specific use is to show broader expanse of
objects, greater breadth of thought, and more intensity of
emotion than can be given by one hand only.
In the preceding classification, with reference to the different positions of the
hand, only leading terms are noted, in the belief that the student will be able
from these to draw correct conclusions with reference to others.

corresponding movements. These are suggested by the fol
lowing Guiding Principles. The lower limbs bend in timid-
ity, advance in courage or progression, retire in fear or cau-
tion, stamp in rage, and start in terror.
INDEX FINGER.
A proper use of the index finger not only gives variety to
gesture, but it enforces an assertion most effectively, espe-
cially when used to distinguish one from a collection, a part
from the whole, or to threaten, warn, or deride.
EXAMPLES.
1. "Yonder stands the cottage in which I was born."

FACIAL EXPRESSION.
The face is the mirror of the emotions; hence it should be
taught to reflect promptly all changes of sentiment and feel-
ing. A voice may be perfect in its modulations; it may set
itself most harmoniously to all forms of uttered language,
yet if the soul of the speaker does not bear record, by index-
ing itself upon the countenance, the aim attempted is, to a

very great degree, marred. Quintilian says, "The face is the
dominant power of expression. With this we supplicate;
with this we threaten; with this we soothe; with this we
mourn; with this we rejoice; with this we triumph; with
this we make our submissions; upon this the audience hang;
upon this they keep their eyes fixed; this they examine and
study even before a word is spoken."
Facial expression may be divided into Unimpassioned and
Impassioned. The former belongs to that which is reposeful
or tranquil, to ordinary conversation, plain narration and
description, and unimpassioned argument. The latter is
used in all kinds of emotional language.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES.
1. A smiling countenance indicates courtesy, joy, good
humor and happiness.
2. The brows contract, the eyes burn, and the lips com-

3. The nose and upper lip are elevated in scorn; and the
brows are raised, the eyes opened, and the lips parted in

shame, and raised in supplication.

When here stands his country, and yonder his foe;
One look on the bright sun, one prayer to sky,
One glance where our banner waves glorious on high;

Let the sword flash on high, fring the scabbard away;
Roll on, like the thunderbolt over the plain;
We come back in glory or we come not again!

lamp-twelve amid the flaming wonders of Orion's belt, if he
crosses the meridian at that fated hour-twelve by the weary
couch of languishing humanity, twelve in the star paved
courts of the Empyrean-twelve for the heaving tides of the
ocean; twelve for the weary arm of labor, twelve for the
toiling brain, twelve for the watching, waking, broken heart;
twelve for the meteor which blazes for a moment and
expires; twelve for the comet whose period is measured by
centuries: twelve for every substantial, for every imaginary
thing, which exists in the sense the intellect, or the fancy,
and which the speech or thought of man, at the given meri-

On yonder jutting cliff, o'ertaken there
By the mountain blast, I've laid me flat along,
And while gust followed gust more furiously,
As if to sweep me o'er the horrid brink,
And I have thought of other lands, whose storms
Are summer-flaws to those of mine, and just

Has checked that wish, and I have raised my head

A voice within us speaks that startling word,

Thick clustering orbs, and this our fair domain,
The tall, dark mountains, and the deep-toned seas,
Join in the solemn, universal song.
Oh! listen ye, our spirits: drink it in
From all the air. "Tis in the gentle moonlight;
'Tis floating midst Day's setting glories! Night,
Wrapped in her sable robe, with silent step
Comes to our bed, and breathes it in our ears:
Night, and the dawn, bright day, and thoughtful eve,
All time, all bounds, the limitless expanse,
As one vast mystic instrument, are touched
By an unseen, living Hand: and conscious chords
Quiver with joy in this great jubilee.

And all as before heard in silence the king,

Unbuckling his girdle, and doffing his mantle;

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS.
*
In Transition, or in passing from one gesture to another,
the hand should not be dropped at the side, but allowed to
pass by graceful movement from one point to the other.
When Climax is required, strengthen each word, phrase, or
assertion, over the preceding one, by a stronger gesture, and
in a manner and direction as may be indicated by the
character of the discourse.
Study nature for attitude and action as well as for speech.
The most noted readers and speakers often furnish worthy
examples. Benefit in this regard may also be derived from
observation of characters in sculpture and painting.

Study Repose of manner: there is repose of action as well
as of inaction; it is the sign of mastery. It is the most
unfailing test of beauty whether of matter or of motion.
CAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED.
1. Avoid false gestures.
2. Avoid crude and ungraceful gestures, except in the oc-
cisional sentiment which may require it.
3. Do not use the whole body when the action of only
one of its members is required.
4. Avoid meaningless gestures; let every movement have
a purpose.
5. Avoid excess in gesture; too few are better than
too many.
6. Never shock the sensibilities of an audience by too
coarse an imitation.
The objects to be attained in Gesture, are ease and appro-
priateness of manner. These objects are usually only at-
tained through time and patient toil. The student should
thoroughly comprehend the Principles, so that in the ap-
plication of the same he may be entirely unconscious of
their existence. Unconsciousness will lead to ease, correct-
ness and variety of movement; it will also be found that as
the soul is stirred by thought and feeling from within, or by
circumstances from without, Gesture will differ at different
times upon the same assertions, and yet at each time be
equally appropriate or correct.
In the adaptation of Gesture to Speech the student should
study to establish the most perfect harmony-otherwise the
effect is to a great degree lost, and at no time should he lose
sight of the fact that the former is a helper rather than an
exponent of the latter.

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION.
In addition to the author's experience of twenty years as an instructor, during
which period he has enjoyed the advantage of rare and varied opportunities for
appreciating the wants of the teacher, it has been his privilege to meet thou.
sands of teachers in professional relations. These contacts, and the observations
they have afforded, have led to much thought and to a profound appreciation of
the teacher's needs in the direction of his special department.
Next to the desire of a broad and intelligent comprehension of the subject,
which he has made a lifelong study, he entertains no stronger desire than that
he may stimulate and help the teacher in his work. No other instruction
within the province of our educational system possesses an equal degree of
practical importance with that of natural, chaste and effective speech. It
relates to the whole man, physical, mental and moral. It relates to every
man of the whole race. It relates to every grade and occupation. It relates to
the every-day life of every man of every grade and every occupation.
To treat the subject of Methods worthily, would require a volume. In the
absence of time and space to give it such consideration as it deserves, there has
been the temptation to ignore it altogether. It is to be hoped that we have deter.
mined more wisely in offering what is now before the student under the two
general divisions, Theory of Teaching and Outline of Methods.
THEORY OF TEACHING.
The first thought of a wise master builder for those who
go down to the sea in ships, is safety of passage. One motive
governs all other considerations: she shall reach her desti-
nation and deliver safely all that has been committed to her.
NOTE.-The Theory of Teaching here presented is from the author's paper
read before the Pennsylvania State Teachers' Association with only such
change as has been deemed necessary to its adaptation here, and to the demand
for a more comprehensive treatment.

Though her sails be of fine linen and her timber of the
goodly cedar, and she be laden with the gold of Ophir or
with the most precious stones, if her timbers yield to the bil
lows, and her wealth be lost in the deep, all is lost, and her
greatness remains only in the greatness of that loss. The
magnificence of her stores only adds to the fearful responsi-
bility of him who sent her upon the waves thus unworthy.
While the educator is rearing the structure of the mind
and freighting it with merchandise, he should remember
that his work does not culminate with a sublime structure
and an abundant cargo. It lies beyond that. He is not
great whose mind is merely a great receptacle, though it be
filled to the brim. That is the vessel of honor which bears
successfully from port to port all that has been committed
to it, and he has built well who has meted out such strength
and pace. He is the educated man, who, freighted with
wise and noble thoughts, bears them successfully to their
proper destination. It is the application of knowledge, not
the possession of it, which constitutes the true end of educa-
tion. The end of life is in giving, not in receiving. A man
is estimated not for what the world gives to him, but for what
he gives to the world. Our subject has to do with one great
medium for the application of knowledge. Very much of
our education, to be available, must be handled, exchanged,
conveyed to its proper port. Like the vessel and its mer-
chandise, it is valuable only at its destination. Along with
knowledge, therefore, and in proportion to it, comes the de-
mand for its proper conveyance and application.
We are by no means disposed to ignore the fact that much
has been achieved by the silent use of knowledge. Some of
the richest fruits of philosophy, science and the arts, have
been given to the world by men and women the most reti-
cent and non-communicative. Through philosophy, inven-
tion alone has given untold stimulus to civilization and
religion, and advanced the world a thousand years. Science
vies with Revelation in proclaiming the wonderful works of
God. The arts are quietly lifting the race into a higher

range of thought and feeling. They are hand-maids phi
lanthropy and civilization, breathing "peace on earn and
good will to men." But it has been reserved for the human
voice to mould and modify every phase and vicissitude of
human life. Whether science or art, the family or the
nation, the Church or State, politics or theology, philosophy
or religion, its influence is felt in all. The human voice is
the great medium for the conveyance of thought and feeling, ·
the outlet and passage-way of the soul, the divine current
which allies man to his fellow. It is the medium by which
knowledge is made universal; a canvas upon which we may
throw thought and feeling that others may see and read.
Soul is here brought to the surface, made tangible and
portable.
But to do this there is needed an instrument, skilled,
accomplished, disciplined. It must not be supposed that the
Creator has here made exception to the common law of
development. Here, as in every other element of our being,
it is "first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the
ear." It is the common order: germ, form, fruit. And the
common process: culture, protection, exercise.
In the treatment of the subject, we shall consider the im-
portance of vocal culture from the teacher's standpoint; cer-
tain common, existing faults of instruction; and such simple
methods as may be presented without illustration.
1. Importance.-The importance of a high cultivation of
the voice is abundantly apparent to us. But it is not enough
that a teacher be himself informed upon his subject; he
must be able to inform others. It is not enough that he be
full himself; he must fill others. How shall we present the
practical bearings of this subject upon our scholars, so that
they may be stimulated to their share of the work? Stand-
ing, therefore, in the teacher's stead for a few minutes, let us
consider the relations of this subject to a generation now in
our hands as clay in the hands of the potter.
Education in any department is important in proportion
as it gives a healthy development of strength and influence.

Whether considered with reference to self or the race, the
voice has the highest claims upon our attention.
As a
physical faculty, the exercise of the human voice concerns
self. A correct, easy utterance demands a natural position
of the body. Proper position conduces to symmetry of
form, which means a healthy development of all the physical
powers. It is a protection to the throat, giving to it muscu-
lar strength and vigor. It promotes proper habits of breath-
ing, and calls into play many of the most vital organs of the
human body. Properly directed, it becomes a most practical
source of health and grace to the whole being.
Natural and healthful exercise is a condition of growth
and development as absolute as air or food. It applies to
our whole triune nature. I gain strength for to-morrow by
what I have done to-day. The mind expands by its exer-
tions. The heart that cherishes the affections of to-day,
burns with a brighter and warmer benevolence to-morrow.
The physical power, therefore, which calls into action the
greatest aggregate amount of physical force, demands in
proportion our attention and proper direction. We need
only call to mind that the throat and lungs, the organs of
respiration, the air we breathe and the manner of breathing
it, the proper adjustment of all the parts of the body, posi-
tion, dress, and digestion itself, are so related to a proper
exercise of the voice as to receive the utmost advantage
from it.
Next to its uses for the sake of self, comes its bearing upon
the family, and those most nearly allied to us, constituting
what is known as the Social Circle. Here begins the media-
torial office of the voice. It becomes here the current of
revelation from the within to the without; and its power
over the thoughts and affections which it bears from us,
though not susceptible of measurement, must be regarded of
vast importance. By it, human weakness may be brought to
the surface, and set as a target for the finger of ridicule; or
it may be covered and hidden from view. Culture of mind
and the purest affection which the heart can give forth, may

come to the surface, coarse and almost vulgar; or fresh, vig.
orous and pure as the fountain whence they issue.
The voice may be taught to reflect upon every relation of
life. The business man lays his voice by the side of his wares,
and the eye of the purchaser harmonizes with the ear in its
judgment. The ear hears a sound harsh and uncomely; the
eye pronounces the cloth coarse and wanting in polish. The
ear hears a voice apologetic and shrinking; the eye pro-
nounces the coffee of questionable quality, and the sugar
adulterated. The ear hears a voice, firm, pure and confi-
dent; the eye sees a fabric of unusual firmness and dura-
bility. We do not pronounce this principle of absolute
force, but of such general bearing as to give it the highest
importance.
The public man presents himself first to the eye and the
ear of his audience. His words approach the judgment with
recommendations from these senses, favorable or unfavorable.
If favorable, he sustains to the audience the position of a
stranger who approaches you with a strong letter from your
friend. You are thrown on his side, and prefer to help him
if you can. So the judgment of the audience is thrown in
the speaker's favor; it prefers to accept his words. If unfa-
vorable, he sustains the relation of him whose approach to
you has been preceded by unfair reflections upon his char-
acter. He finds a barrier in the way of his access to you.
The voice is in many instances a barrier in the way of a
speaker's access to the mind and heart,weakening and modi-
fying the words, sometimes to such a degree that they are
utterly lost. The voice is often so at variance with the senti-
ment, as to convey a meaning almost in contrast with the
purpose of the speaker. But we dare not dwell. It may be
readily shown in all relations, First, that the voice should
satisfy, and, if it be possible, gratify the ear. Second, that it
should sustain and strengthen the sentiment. Third, that it
should vary in harmony with the sentiment.
The culture of the voice should be taught as a matter of
cleanliness. A sluggish, slovenly tone is as filthy as an un-
combed head, or a collar ten days worn. It should be taught

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION.
175
as a matter of courtesy. You owe it to your neighbor to give
him a pure tone as much as the tip of the hat or the morn-
ing salutation. It should be taught as an element of happi-
ness. Our highest happiness is reflex. It is that which
comes back to us from the joy we have given to others. No
other agency within the compass of our natural power is so
adapted to the communication of happiness to others as the
human voice. It should be taught as an agency of moral
culture. A voice of dignity and elegance will attract to purity
and truth, to virtue and religion. Correct sounds should be
taught as a preservation of the language. Sounds errone-
ously pronounced during school days will so develop the
organs in that direction as to be corrected with difficulty.
The habit will often prejudice the ear against that which is
correct.
Faults. In considering the faults most common in our
education of the voice, I call attention first to the wide-
spread habit of forcing loud and boisterous tones, rather
than intelligent responses. There is a tendency on the part
of teachers to obtain sound without much reference to sense.
Very often, too, it is obtained at the expense of every natu-
ral use of the organs, rendering the voice harsh and discord-
ant, and physically weakened. It has its worst phase in the
harsh, fierce utterance of the letters of the alphabet, and in
spelling and early reading lessons. The child should be
taught to give the name of the first letter of the alphabet,
and every letter intelligently, as it would to give the name of
any one object in the room, whole, complete, with firm, pure,
voice, and nothing more. A greater fault consists in the
almost total want of attention to the voices of pupils outside
of the few minutes devoted to the reading classes proper.
Though the pupil may be in only one reading class, every
class should be a voice class in which the voice is used. It is
worse than absurd to expect any satisfactory results in the
culture of the voice while it is used properly in one recitation
and improperly in five. If there is anything in practice, then
the faults of the voice must have greatly the advantage.
Again, the body of sound is rarely correct. The a, e, i, o, u,


## p. 176 (#178) ############################################

of speech is neglected. The organs are not properly set, and
consequence there is not obtained that resonance and flexi-
ility of which almost every voice is capable. Head tones,
mouth tones, and throat tones are left uncorrected, and with
every repetition, are more strongly fixed in the habit of the
student.
Then, there is great neglect of the true source of vocal
strength. Few students in our public schools ever learn to
command the lower part of the lungs and the abdominal
muscles during utterance, and in consequence always use the
voice to disadvantage. The lower muscles of the body con-
stitute the fulcrum power of the voice, and to speak without
using them is like lifting a heavy weight from an unnatural
position. Strength is wasted. Thousands are constantly
exhausting physical force in speech which might be saved if
the proper organs were brought into play. Had we time we
could adduce a number of instances of persons whose speech
had become painful and burdensome, who so changed the
location of the tone in a few days' time as to speak with
entire ease.
In Articulation there is almost a universal tendency to a
sluggish and unfinished utterance of the sounds in a word.
This fault has various forms, sometimes pervading the whole
sentence, sometimes affecting only those words in which the
lips or teeth have a prominent part to perform, and very
often dropping the last sound of the word. A distinct
enunciation reflects culture and education upon the speaker
and shows such a respect for his words, on his own part, as
will command the respect of the listener. Many of the
sounds of the language are commonly pronounced incor-
rectly. Almost every community has perverted some of the
sounds to such a degree that they have entered into the
common language of the community and become provincial.
The teacher is the guardian of the tongue he speaks, and
should conscientiously protect it from innovation upon the
authorized sounds which compose the language.
The faults of Expression in the average American are

177
indeed "too numerous to mention." There is monotony of
expression, and excess of expression. There is the formal,
stilted, uniform rate, and the loose, reckless, hasty speech.
There is the pious style of drawl and downward slide, and
there is the coarse, abrupt and dogged style. Against all of
these we may reverently use the language of the prayer-
book, and ask to be delivered.
A healthy child will usually be found to possess, in a very
high degree, the elements of varied and appropriate ex-
pression. It will use the high and the low, the loud and the
soft, the fast and the slow, with wonderful faithfulness to the
meaning and would very often require little but protection,
but too often the example of the playmate and the parent
and the misdirection of the teacher are sufficient, within very
early years, to supplant natural simplicity of expression and
establish in its place painfully unnatural habits.
In Gesture, the faults of position and movement, like those of
expression, are usually acquired through example and mis-
direction. The child of six, compelled to sit on a square
foot of territory six hours in the day, will break down under
the unnatural oppression and the form will droop. The boy
that is required to "stand erect" only on Friday afternoon,
when he "6 speaks his piece," will absorb the idea of a
mechanical uprightness for the speaking occasion, and that
some such preparation is necessary every time he makes his
speech; and we accordingly find in the pulpit and at the bar
more uprightness than grace. The healthy little child, as a
rule, is graceful and appropriate in its movements. The
larger child has rounded shoulders and drags his feet a little.
The largest child droops in body, walks with bowed legs and
carries his head at an unnatural poise, and the man and
woman are the natural result of the years of such training.
3. Remedy.—The remedy for many of the faults so common
in speech lies within the reach of almost every teacher. No
instrument was ever committed to human care and manage-
ment, capable of such delicate variety and harmony as the
voice of the average child. Pure as the morning breeze,

sporting as the winged songster, versatile as the mountain
stream, is the prattle of happy childhood. Nature has
shown herself more lavish in the instrument of communica-
tion than in the knowledge to be communicated. The God-
given voice is greatly superior to the God-given knowledge.
The natural suggestion is, that the culture of the voice should
be assigned its proper place in the van of all higher culture.
The fact is, they are educated inversely. Processes of devel-
opment are applied to the mind tending to natural and vig-
orous growth. A lifetime is devoted to storing in knowledge,
while the great channel of communication is almost entirely
neglected. The voice is left to itself; and, in one, is dwarfed
for want of the necessary attention and nourishment; in
another, for want of proper pruning and direction, is allowed
to run into the most unnatural vagaries.
We submit, there should be early attention given to the
habits of voice in the child. The voice in recitation should
not be diverted from the simplest and purest tones of its
ordinary use. When false tendencies are discovered, they
should be promptly corrected, whether on the play-ground,
in the morning salutation, or in the grammar recitation, as
well as in the reading class. The current of tone should be
kept in the proper channel, and the stimulants of cleanliness,
courtesy, business and morality, to which reference has
already been made, applied in due proportion and with due
caution. A faculty of such constant exercise, it is eminently
important that the most careful attention be given to the
habit of voice in the practice of the child.
I am told that so little attention has been given to this
subject in the education of the teacher, that he is unprepared
to criticise the voice of the pupil.
While admitting the force of the difficulty, yet were he
ordinarily to apply the principle of correcting bad habits as
far as he knows, we believe great good would be done, and
he would be led to the discovery of much that is unknown.
In addition to this direction and correction of the voice,
pleasing and varied exercises should be mingled with the
H

reading exercises, such as the ear will enjoy. The ear shou d
be led as rapidly as possible to enjoy sounds. It will thus
soon discriminate between what it likes and what it dislikes,
and this accomplished, the point of a higher and closer dis-
crimination is not far distant. The teacher should aim to
secure in the pupil the criticism of his own ear. A most
important work is done when this is attained. Every indica-
tion in this direction should be encouraged by the teacher.
When the flat, high, hard, harsh or excessive nasal tones are
observed by the pupil, and hurt as they fall upon the ear,
the
teacher's work is largely done. The student is then put under
a critic more faithful and constant than the teacher can pos-
sibly be to him.
Nothing can take the place of judicious exercise of the
elementary sounds in early practice. The drill on these,
carefully varied, should form a daily exercise in our primary
schools. The greatest care should be taken in all these ex-
ercises to develop chest tones, versus head, throat, or mouth
tones. I shall suggest a single additional element in the cul-
ture of the voice. The teacher cannot impress the value of
proper breathing with too much emphasis. Deep, full breath-
ing should be urged as a habit, not merely as an exercise.
Every muscle and organ within the whole range of the re-
spiratory system should act with each successive breath.
The intercostal muscles are very largely dependent upon
breathing for their exercise. By it, the lungs are rendered
capacious and flexible, the muscles of the sides and back are
strengthened, the whole body has added form and comeli-
ness, and the voice obtains a strength and resonance which
it can have from no other source.
A new era is dawning in the history of education with
reference to human speech. In our haste after principles
we have overlooked the fact, that culture as well as know-
ledge must supplement nature. In the palmy days of oratory,
and in the age of its masters, the culture of the voice was
held of first importance. We believe that within the possi-
bilities of this wonderful instrument, there may be found a

response to every sentiment of the mind and every emotion
of the heart. And it is not an idle hope that in proportion
as the mind of man expands to a wider range, and the
human heart glows in a higher benevolence, and human
nature is absolved from sin, the voice may be first to reflect
the Divine image, in tones such as make up the melody of
Heaven.

SUGGESTION TO THE TEACHER.-While it is believed that a somewhat definite
order of outline will best represent to the teacher the important principles in-
volved in Primary Instruction, yet it is by no means supposed that he will
follow, slavishly, the explanation of the several steps here given.
The teacher should have in mind some simple sentence,
for example, "It is my hat." Presuming that the pupils
know nothing of the letters or words, the task before him is
to teach them the thought of the sentence, the four words, the
seven different letters and the seven sounds which compose
the sentence, and to enable them to express the thought
naturally. upon sight. The latter is preeminently the end to

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION.
181
be attained, and the steps leading to it should be so con-
ducted as will best accomplish this end.
IDEA. The teacher may introduce the object hat to his
class, and conduct an object lesson. It will aid in impressing
the appearance of the word when it is presented.
IDEA WORD.-The class may be lead by appropriate ques-
tions, to the idea involved in the sentence. When I say
"hat," what do you think about? When I show you this
(pointing to the object, hat), what do you think about?
What is the name of this object? That name is a word.
Can you see the word "hat" when I say it with my mouth?
Where are words put so that you can see them? Would you
know the word "hat" if I should show it to you? I will
now show you the word "hat," and I want you to remember
what it looks like, so that you will know it whenever you
see it.
Nothing more should be attempted at this lesson than to
impress the appearance of the word "hat" upon the minds
of the class.
force
SOUNDS. By prolonging the pronunciation of the word
"hat," the teacher can readily show to the smallest class,
that it is composed of different sounds; and that, to say the
word "hat" is only to put these sounds so close together that
no one will know where they are separated. The children
should, at the same time, be taught to give the sounds.
LETTER.-Each one of these sounds has a name. Tell the
children that the name of the first sound heard in the word
"hat" is h. Show them the letter h and show them that it
is the same as the first mark or form in the word "hat."
The sound and the name of the sound should then be
frequently alternated until the class will associate them
readily, and promptly recognize either.
OTHER WORDS.-The other words of the sentence should
be taught first by name and then separated into sounds
according to the methods suggested for the word "hat."
READING.-The teacher of primary pupils should not
upon them any technical definition of Reading, but he

182
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
should so conduct their approach to it, that they will absor
the idea that Reading is saying something from words that are
seen.
The pupils, before seeing the sentence, "It is my hat,"
should be capable of pronouncing the words of the sentence
upon sight, as promptly as they would pronounce the
names of their classmates or of their brothers and sisters.
The teacher should call from the child an expression of the
sentence before it is seen: "Harry, suppose your hat is in
your hand. If I ask you, whose hat have you in your hand,
what will you say?" He may answer, "It's mine." The
teacher need only tell him that it is prettier and more cor-
rect to say, "It is my hat," and that, as he comes to school
to learn, he should now answer in those words. rry,
whose hat is that? The answer will be an expression and not
a merely formal utterance of the words, as if the teacher had
pointed in succession to "It" and "is and "my" and
"hat." The expression thus obtained should then be used as
a model for the child. How did you say "It is my hat?"
The child repeats, and in the repetition is copying from his
own natural expression, or fronı nature.
The model having been obtained, let the teacher direct the
pupils to the sentence upon the board or chart, asking,
"What have you in your hand?" They will answer with
a proper expression of the words which their eyes now see.
Tell them this is reading, and they have absorbed the idea
that Reading is saying something from words that are seen.
The object has been to approach Reading by another path
than through pronunciation. The usual impression left
upon the child is, "When I can pronounce the words of the
sentence, I can read it. I can pronounce the words of this
sentence, therefore I can read it." This is fundamentally
wrong. It is exalting a prerequisite of reading to reading.
Pronunciation, or knowing words on sight, is as much a pre-
requisite of Reading as knowing figures is a prerequisite of
arithmetic. Pupils should be constantly impressed with the
idea, when they attempt to read, that it is taken for granted

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION.
183
that they know the words. By the above process, the pupil
will be early led to comprehend that when he, knowing the
words, knows what they mean, and says them that others may
know what they mean, he is reading.
ADVANCED INSTRUCTION.
Processes for the cultivation and modulation of the voice,
a further knowledge of the sounds of the language and
of their modifications, and the study and practice of gesture,
should here be introduced, according to the age and grade of
the pupils. and continued systematically in connection with
all the lessons in reading. The principles governing Primary
Instruction should be continued as long as there is necessity
for them. The great principle there presented should be
kept equally prominent in Advanced Instruction.
The following outline is presented as a suggestive guide to
the teacher of the advanced reading class:
First. Read the lesson for the class.
NOTE.-Pupils will thus obtain a general impression of the selection, and
will be stimulated to the preparation of the thought.
Second. Pupils prepare sentiment of the lesson.
NOTE.-This relates to their study of the selection between recitations.
Third. Pupils give back the sentiment of the lesson in
their own words, with explanation and anecdote.
NOTE.-At least one period should be thus devoted preparatory to reading a
new selection. It is a test of the pupils' knowledge of the sentiment. It culti-
vates conversation outside of the usual commonplace conversation of chil-
dren. It cultivates a conversational style of expression and establishes the
thought of the lesson in the mind of the pupil.
Fourth. Word preparation.
Fifth. Reading.
NOTE.-Only a part of the lesson should be assigned for word preparation and
reading, by which we refer to such practice on the difficult words as wi'l secure
their familiarity to the eye of the scholar; also, the reading of individual sen-
tences and paragraphs with reference to expression.


## p. 184 (#186) ############################################

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
Sixth. Review upon
merit.
NOTE 1.-A half dozen lessons may be devoted to the above exercises upon a
single selection. The pupils should be marked upon their lessons as in other
branches, and allowed, according to the rank of their marks, to read a part
or all of the selection before the class. This exercise may be continued in the
order of the marks received upon preparation, until all have read before the
class.
NOTE 2.-Two selections may be kept before the class at one time, one in the
process of review upon merit, the other in the process of preparation. This,
with practical exercises, as suggested, will give abundant variety to the recita-
tion.
TO THE TEACHER.-The teacher who desires to obtain for his pupils rapid
progress in pure, natural expression, should be faithful in his observation and
criticism upon their habits of speech in all the recitations of the school, and
as he may meet them at their homes or upon the playground The lesson in
geography or arithmetic should be given in pure voice, clear er◄nciation, and
with intelligent expression.


## p. 185 (#187) ############################################

APPENDIX.
MISCELLANEOUS SUGGESTIONS.
1. In Reading and Speaking, let each separate thought be
well defined; let it be expressed with full meaning and in
due proportion.
2. With reference to Enunciation there should be such a
nearness of the words, the one to the other, as will preserve
a magnetic connection, and yet sufficient separation to pro-
tect the individuality of each. A failure to observe the first
will give a labored style; and a failure to observe the second
will produce indistinctness.
3. The speaker should be governed by the following funda-
mental principles in the study of Public Address. First.
He should reduce the expression to natural and original
simplicity and truth, measured by an appropriate conversa-
tion of the same language to a single individual. Second.
He should so magnify that original simplicity that it may be
as forcible to each of a multitude as it would have been if ad-
dressed to one individual.
4. The student should practice frequently, and observe his
habit constantly, rather than to continue practice until weary
and disinterested.


## p. 186 (#188) ############################################

186
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
5. In reference to style of expression, the student should
practice often against inclination and natural taste; other-
wise he will become limited in style.
6. Reserve characterization for such sentiment as is depend-
ent upon the characterization for its effect.
When it is ap-
'parent that an author has written for the thought, though put
in the mouth of a specific character, the reader should make
prominent the thought rather than divert it by intruding the
character.
7. The study of Elocution is the study of the highest natu-
ral expression. Our highest natural expression can only be
attained through our highest manhood and womanhood.
The student, therefore, should regard CHARACTER in voice
and manner as of primary importance in the study of Elocu
tion.
EMPHASIS.
Emphasis gives due prominence to the important thoughts
of discourse. It employs all the processes of expression,
quality, pitch, force, time, and slides.
A sentence is usually composed of a capital idea, subordi-
nate or dependent ideas, and their connections. The word
or words expressing the capital idea represent the object for
which the sentence was written, and claim such emphasis
as will give it corresponding prominence in speech. The
subordinate ideas are modifications of the capital thought,
and the word or words expressing them require correspond-
ing modifications of emphasis. The connectives are the
linkings of the capital and subordinate ideas, and usually
require little more than a correct vocal utterance for their
expression. Varied and appropriate emphasis constitutes
the highest skill of intellectual expression.
GROUPING.-A proper grouping of words closely related to
each other is highly important to correct Emphasis.

MISCELLANEOUS VOCAL EXERCISES.
NOTE.-The following exercises may be made a continuation of the Table of
Vocal Exercises on page 41. They may be used with great interest and profit
by the judicious teacher in connection with, or in preparation for, the regular
reading lesson.
ē
aw
ah
ah
aw
NOTE.-These sounds, in the order they are placed, if properly rendered,
will represent the purest chest, throat, and head tones of which the voice is
capable. The student should be careful to observe that there is a pure throat
tone and a pure head tone, in contradistinction from the chest tone, but that
each should possess what may be termed a chest resonance.
2.
Co, boss! co, boss! co! co! co!
3. Toll, toll, toll. Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
4. A, ǎ, ē, ě, I, I, ō, Ŏ, ū, u.
NOTE.-These may be practiced in various ways, but a special advantage may
be received from their frequent repetition in the same breath.
6. Battalion-Right about-Turn-Forward.
Halt-Fix Bayonets-Quick-March.
Double-Charge.
5. Select the names of a number of hotels, and express
them according to taste or fancy, in imitation of a variety of
hackmen at a railroad depot.
7. "Pull, pull in your lassos and bridle to steed,
And speed, if ever for life you would speed,
And ride for your lives, for your lives you must ride;
For the plain is aflame, the prairie on fire;
And feet of wild horses hard flying before,
I hear like a sea breaking high on the shore;
While the buffalo come like the surge of the sea,
Driven far by the flame, driving fast on us three,
As a hurricane comes, crushing palms in his ire:"
NOTE. This exercise is given with special reference to economy of breath.
Read rapidly, articulate distinctly, and consume the least possible breath.

NOTE.-In the first of these exercises there should be a separation of pitch
between the first three and the second three, to the extent of an octave. In the
second, change the pitch to the same degree upon each successive word. In the
third exercise, let the voice pass through the same degree of pitch, making the
changes as the diagram suggests.

LAUGHTER.
No other exercise is more healthful, either to the mind or
body, than pure, natural laughter. The judicious practice of
this as an exercise, in representation of the various styles of
laughter, will be found useful and invigorating. Here again
the long vowel sounds alone, or preceded by the sound of h,
may be used with excellent effect. The student will readily
find other exercises appropriate for practice.
BIBLE READING.
It will be conceded that no other language is so rich in
meaning as the language of the Bible. Great leading truths
are but the branches upon which cluster the most varied
practical lessons of wisdom and virtue.
Almost whole books of the sacred writings are marked in
each successive sentence with this abundant fruitfulness of
meaning. With but an equal amount of attention and
preparation, it is, therefore, but natural that there would be
correspondingly, a greater failure in giving full and complete
expression to the language of the Bible than to the language
of human origin.
In the most ordinary forms of speech, a part of the sense
is constantly lost for want of a proper adaptation in the
modulations of the voice. How much more this must be
true where almost every word has an important bearing
upon the whole, thus requiring a constantly changing
variety of tone, time, stress and slide, in giving completeness
to the sense. Here may be based two great classes of evils
in expression.
1st. That form of expression which yields only a part of the
meaning. We have a vast field of utterance, marked by
various degrees of monotony, in which only a part of the
meaning is brought out. No injustice may be done to that
which is said, but it is not all said. Important words are lost


## p. 190 (#192) ############################################

190
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
in the general tone. The lights and shades of modulation
are slighted, thus robbing the author of much that his words
should have been made to convey. Through ignorance of
the power of these changes, or the neglect of them, precious
utterances are rendered fruitless and barren.
2d. A perversion of the true meaning. A quality of voice at
variance with the sentiment, an improper pitch, a misplaced
emphasis, inappropriate time, a false slide or inflection, may
so utterly destroy the sense, and misrepresent the meaning, as
to divert the words entirely from their purpose.
It should be made the conscientious practice of every
reader of the Bible, first to satisfy his own mind as to the
meaning of each passage, and then to see that his rendering
will properly represent that meaning.
In addition to these common wants of expression, there is
a variety of styles, in popular use, peculiar to Bible reading,
against which we utter a most respectful, though a most
earnest protest.
1st. Professional Style.
This is capable of sub-division into a number of varieties,
but with so little in favor of either, as to give no ground for
distinction in the general objection. The reader should
avoid any style that is professional, if for no other reason than
that it is professional.
2d. Inflated Style.
There is that form of utterance which says in the tone and
manner, "I am commissioned to handle this message.
Behold me! Listen to me!" At which, great swelling
sounds issue forth, with the unfortunate effect that Divine
words are lost in human sound. We should ever recognize by
a humility of tone and manner that the words are Jehovah's.
3d. Pious Tone.
We are not opposed to the utmost purity of voice, marked
with a manly dignity and a becoming solemnity, but there
prevails a variety of cant and whine which should fall under


## p. 191 (#193) ############################################

APPENDIX.
191
the same condemnation which God Himself pronounces
upon other lip service. The best gift which God gave to man
in the flesh, is his manhood; and we will not believe that He
meant we should lose that manhood when uttering His
words. If ever it should glow and burn in all its Divine
origin, it is when thus standing in God's stead.
4th. Trifling Style.
This style, in contrast with professional dignity and exces-
sive piety, is no less to be guarded against. King's messages,
the proclamations of Chief Magistrates, the language of the
wise and learned, claim a corresponding dignity of expres-
sion; how much more the words of Infinite Power and of
Infinite Wisdom.
It is evident that the very purpose of the Divine Word
may be thwarted by the tone and manner. God has made
His word simple. Do not rob it of that simplicity by bring-
ing in a profundity of expression. He has brought it down
to the comprehension of the human mind. Do not give
such an inhuman utterance as to raise it up out of the reach
of humanity.
God has made it plain. Do not involve it in mystery by
vacant, weird and professional tones. God meant it for man.
Do not read it to the angels. It is the word of the dear
Heavenly Father, full of mercy and the tenderest affection.
Do not read it as the message of an Absolute Monarch.
Yet, it is God's word. Avoid that reckless vagabondish man-
ner which so often marks the utterance of human language.
It is God's truth, meant for man. Read it as of old they
read “in the law of God, distinctly, and gave the sense, and
caused them to understand the reading."
SOUND TO SENSE.
A vast number of words in the language afford special
opportunity for significant expression through the sounds of
which they are composed. There is an obvious harmony


## p. 192 (#194) ############################################

192
PRACTICAL ELOCUTION.
between the sounds and the meaning of the words, us in
the following examples: Dash, round, noble, rich, sublime,
brisk, strength, poor, little, great, whirlwind, glory, rough,
smooth, fresh, victory, thunder, old, ragged, murmur, repose.
NOTE. Such words are much more numerous than is generally supposed,
and they should be carefully practiced in the preparation of a selection.
TRANSITION.
Prompt and appropriate change of voice and manner in
harmony with the changing effects of language, is indis-
pensable to the art of expression. Discourse is often like the
dissolving view, interesting and effective largely from its
contrasts. It requires one or more of the corresponding
contrasts of quality, pitch, force, time, position, countenance,
or movement.
ANALYSIS.
With a view to a clear comprehension of the language to
be spoken, it is highly important that the student form the
habit of a close analysis of the thought, and of the applica-
tion of modulation and action to its expression. The intelli-
gent student of literature will have practical methods for the
mental analysis of sentiment, yet he may be aided towards
its expression by the answer of such questions as the follow-
ing: Who wrote the language? When did he write it?
Why did he write it? What were the motives which prompted
aim to think the thought here expressed? What would be
the state of mind and heart of one in a condition to utter
such language? If the conditions of life had so borne upon
nie as to call from me such thought, how would I express it?
When the reader has thus investigated the language of the
author, and analyzed the source of the thought it expresses,
he has touched a corresponding source in his own nature, and
has sprung upon himself the motives and the conditions of
mind and body best fitted to its expression.


## p. 193 (#195) ############################################

APPENDIX.
193
In addition to this general analysis he may also ascertain
the character of tone, the changes of tone, the position
of the body, and the movement necessary to express the
particular thought. What general quality of voice should
be used to express the thought? Does the language suggest
any exception to the general quality? What is the general
pitch? And what are the exceptions to the general pitch?
What is the prevailing force and what are the exceptions to
the prevailing force? With reference to slides, do the
positive or negative qualities of sentiment prevail? What
attitude or position of body would best reflect the general
thought, and what changes are demanded? What of the
facial expression? Does the language suggest conversational,
oratorical, or dramatic ac n?
Such analysis as this on the part of the student will lead
to a prompt and appropriate association of voice and manner
with the sentiment to be expressed.
NOTE.-The student will constantly find difficulty in distinguishing the quality
of the voice or the degree of pitch or force, or the shade of slide, or the particu-
lar action which the thought suggests. Sentiment is so subtle and its changes
so imperceptible that it will be impossible to follow it by any order of reasoning,
and he must be content with discovering the tendency of the thought with refer-
ence to the various mediums of expression.
REPOSE.
Our conceptions of God lead us to think of a being not idle,
but one to whom labor is rest; so wise that He knows without
exertion; so abundant in resources that the supply is ever
equal to the demand. A noble conception of God has never
created a being subject to excitement, or agitation, or one
who could be moved or changed by the agitations of His
creatures. He spake and it was brought forth. He speaks
and it is done. He bids alike the storm or the calm. He
commands the light or the darkness, and it obeys him.
Art is the effort of the creature to reproduce the work of

the Creator. When God made man, He breathed into him
the breath of life, and in that breath of life was the breath or
germ of divinity, and in proportion as man becomes infused
with the divine breath, in proportion as he has much of God
within him may he hope to breathe into his art divine breath,
be it the marble, the canvas, the printed page, or the human
voice; and no other power of art will so reflect divine power
as repose. The highest power is mastery, and the highest
mastery is self-mastery, and of self-mastery repose is the em-
blem. The orator, next to God himself, needs to possess
the world, and to possess the world he must first possess him-
self, his hand, his foot, his eye, his breath, his body, his
mind, his soul. Then, art shall have linked itself with
divinity.

NATIONAL SCHOOL
OF
Elocution and Oratory,
Nos. 1416 AND 1418 CHESTNUT STREET,
PHILADELPHIA.
J. W. SHOEMAKER, A. M., Founder.
PRIVATE AND CLASS INSTRUCTION.
Beginning with Conversation as the gift of nature, it is our first
and highest aim to secure the habit of chaste and elegant speech.
A pure, full voice, correct and distinct enunciation, natural and
forcible expression, are regarded essential elements of impressive
conversation. These principles applied to reading render it simple
and natural, and free from monotony and excess.
A careful system of vocal training will tend, not only to the
healthful preservation of the powers of the voice, but will often
discover to the student capabilities of which he was before
unconscious.
The course also includes Lectures upon Methods of Teaching
and Public Address, with abundant and varied practice in Reading
and Recitation.

SPECIALTIES.
'N addition to our own publications herein mentioned,
we make a specialty of supplying works relating
to Elocution and Oratory, either in quantity or
single copies. Orders for books upon any subject will
receive our prompt attention and be filled upon most
favorable terms.
For some time past we have felt the necessity of
effecting an arrangement whereby we could supply the
constant and increasing demand for
Special Selections.
It gives us great pleasure to announce that we now
have facilities for filling this long-felt want. Selections
are frequently read in public which please the audience
and lead them to desire a copy, but not being personally
acquainted with the reader, and knowing neither the
author nor the publisher, they are at a loss to know how
to proceed to obtain it. In most cases if the title be
given us, or a short description of the selection, we can
send the name and cost of the book in which the selec-
tion is found; and upon receipt of price, we will for
ward a copy of the work.

A TIMELY WORK ON A VITAL TOPIC.
T
HIS new book deals with a subject of deep interest to all who
have occasion to speak in public. İt therefore appeals
not only to those who are connected with the affairs of
Government-National, State and Municipal-but
also to members of Boards of Education, of Public Institu-
tions, of Public Works, of Exchange, of Finance, to
Officers and Directors of Railroads, Banks, Insur-
ance and other Companies, and to all who have plans to
present and opinions to express upon current questions, and who
desire to so marshal their thoughts and words as to carry conviction
to the minds of their hearers and advance the cause advocated by
the speaker.
While the different modes of speech are fully described, and the
special merits of other forms of address are clearly pointed out, the
particular object of this book is to show how a man of average
ability may learn to speak extemporaneously with
ease and certainty. Mere generalities are discarded, while
all those little details of practical work which the theorist overlooks
are made prominent. Some parts of the work are simple
enough to be comprehended by a school-boy, and
may be applied by him in his first efforts; other parts may be
read with profit by the orator already in the maturity of
his
powers.
Not every man may become a Clay or a Webster, yet whoever
follows the directions here given may feel assured that he is on
the high-road to the greatest success within the reach
of his faculties.

ELOCUTIONARY CHARTS.
BY J. W. SHOEMAKER, A. M.,
Late President of the National School of Elocution and Oratory.
At the request of a large number of students, we have prepared and published
for public use the charts of the NATIONAL SCHOOL OF ELOCUTION AND ORATORY,
thus atlording to teachers the benefit of our long experience and ripest thought
in the analysis of this important department of culture, as well as in the selection
and arrangement of exercises for the natural and healthy development of the voice.
No. 1 is a large wall chart 60 x 72 inches, handsomely engraved and mounted,
entitled
Outline of Elocution and Analysis of Principles.
The arrangement of this Chart is striking and suggestive, and presents a clear
and practical analysis of the whole subject. Beginning with the DEFINITIONS of
Elocution, it proceeds to treat of its IMPORTANCE, of CONVERSATION as its basis,
of PRINCIPLES and of METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. The outline of these topics,
with their natural subdivisions, will enable the teacher to proceed systematically
with the work of instruction, and will at the same time assist the student to an
intelligent comprehension of the subject. It suggests the necessity of voice
culture, and of careful drill in the Elements of Speech as indispensable to the art
of expression. No. 2 is a wall chart 32 x 44 inches, entitled
TABLE OF VOCAL EXERCISES,
presenting in outline the system of voice culture employed by the NATIONAL
SCHOOL OF ELOCUTION AND ORATORY, and will be found of very great practical
value to teachers or students, and to all interested in this important field of Art.
Voice culture is universally recognized as one of the fundamental requisites of
effective Elocution, and our broad experience in this department of teaching war-
rants us in the belief that by careful training and judicious exercise, this desira-
ble accomplishment may be acquired by all. The distinctive aims of this Chart
are to secure PURITY, POWER, FLEXIBILITY and CHARACTER of tone. Begin-
ning with the long vowel sounds, NATURAL and CONVERSATIONAL, it proceeds
to the systematic Cultivation of the voice, in response to the whole field of sen-
timent and passion. Then by a carefully arranged set of sentences these princi-
ples are immediately applied to expression, thus securing to the student such
facility in their use as will enable him to apply them either in Conversation, in
Reading, or in Puolic Address.
