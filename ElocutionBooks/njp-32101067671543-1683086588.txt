It was not meant to give anything
original to the world; the only praiſe
which the Publiſhers aſpire to, is that of
having made a careful, and, they hope,
not an injudicious Compilation.
The firſt Effay, however, is an origi-

has been long practiſed in the Art of
Speaking:--The two next are extracted
from works of eſtabliſhed credit.-As for
the large collection of Examples, which
makes up the greateſt part of the book,

TO THE READER:
ſome or other of theſe pieces will afford
a juft occafion of employing it. Thie
firſt object was to furniſh a proper field:
of exerciſe, to ſuch as are ftudious to ac-
compliſh themſelves in the Arts of Read-
ing and Declaiming; yet at the ſame
time ſuch attention has been paid to the
intrinſic merit of the pieces admitted into
this Collection, that we flatter ourſelyes
it will ſerve another and even a more
valuable purpoſe, and will be found well
adapted to improve both the underſtand-
ing and the heart; to form the one to juft
affections, and to ſtore the other with a
variety of agreeable ideas and uſeful ſen-
timents. There is ſcarce a paper in the
book but will readily be acknowledged,
in reſpect both of fenſe and ſtyle, to be
truly excellent in its kind ; it holds up
none but the beſt models to the ſcholar;
and if any one ſhould take it up for the
amuſement of a leiſure hour, in fo various
a collection it will not be difficult to find
ſomething correſpondent to his taſte and
humour.

Tranſitions, Cadences, and Geſture.
EMPHASIS may be divided into two branches, Ex-
planatory and Expreſlive; by the firſt is meant that
ftreſs of utterance, which preſents more clearly to
conception the meaning of what we deliver; as for
example:-“ A popular man is, in truth, no better
than a proſtitute to common fame, and to the prople;
he lies down to every one he meets, for the hire of
praiſe, and his humility is only a diſguiſed ambition.”
By marking the preceding panlage so, the mean-
ing ſtrikes immediately with full force ; whereas if
the ſtreſs were laid upon other words, or if the whole
was uttered with Monotony, (a fameneſs of tone)
the fenie would be confuſed, and to a hearer, whoſe
apprehenſion was not very quick, perhaps quite unin-
telligible.--In caſes where the ſenſe is doubtful, pro-
per Emphaſis is indiſpenſibly neceſſary; for inſtance:

A HELP TO ELOCUTION.
Did the Engliſhman deſerve to die? - If I lay the
ſtreſs upon did, then it marks a queſtion ariſing from
ſurprize ; if Engliſhman is diſtinguiſhed, then it iin-
plies that others were concerned, and that I would
know his caſe particularly.- If die is marked, then it
appears that I admit guilt, but want to know if his
crime was of ſuch a nature as to deferve capital pu-
niſhment.
EXPRESSIVE EMPHASIS is that which is uſed to
render a paſſage, whoſe meaning is obvious, more
forcible, as may appear by properly marking the fol-
lowing paſſage from Shakeſpeare *.
In this, ye Gods, you make the weak moſt ſtrong ;
In this, ye Gods, you tyrants do defeat;
Norſtony tow'rs, nor walls of beaten braſs,
Nor airleſs dungcon, nor Jirong links of iron,
Can be retentive to the ſtrength of ſpirit;
But life, being weary of theſe worldly bars,
Never lacks power to diſmiſs itſelf.
He bids the SPIRY firs ariſe,
The cedar, vig'rous, pierce the ſkies,
From Lebanon's chill brow:
Fearleſs, amid conflicting ſtorms,
The tow'ring ſtork his cradle forms,
High on the founding bough.
By laying the Emphaſis on ſpiry, in the firſt line,
'the peculiar form of the trees mentioned is explain-
ed; whereas, had the ſtreſs been laid upon firs, it
would leave us at liberty to think oaks, elms, &c.
fpiry too. The word ariſe is marked, as being the
purport of a command ; and though, in general, the
voice falls at the end of a line, yet in this caſe the
meaning requires it ſhould be raiſed, but not too high,
nor abruptly.
In the ſecond line vig'rous is marked as a property
of the cedar; indeed all Epithets, whether they
precede
* The words printed in Italic are thoſe on which the Em-
phaſis is laid ; but words in CAPITALS require a more forcible
Emphaſis than thoſe in Italic.

precede or follow, require Emphaſis.Pierce is
noted as painting a quickneſs and boldneſs of vege.
tation, while the imagination is raiſed to a more
than ordinary height by particularizing ſkies.
In the third line chill is marked as a characteriſtic
quality of the climate of Lebanon.
Fearleſs, in the fourth line, is pointed out as an
extraordinary attribute of a bird, and conflicting ſtorms
are emphatical as a proof of that attribute, enlarging
the idea much more than the ſimple word fearleſs,
unaſſiſted would have done.
In the fifth line tow'ring is diſtinguiſhed as an Epi-
thet; and cradle, which happily deſcribes the ſtork's
neſt in that rocking fituation, is diſtinguiſhed as the
motive of the bird's reſolution.
In the laſt line high is marked as a material point
of the imagery, and ſounding not only as an Epithet,
but alſo as referring to its turbulent ſituation among
whiſtling or roaring gales.
I have choſen this ſtanza of the 104th Pfalm, as
pictureſque poetry reits more upon Emphaſis than
any other ſpecies of writing; and I have been ſo mi-
nute in the explanation of it, not only that my
meaning might be underſtood as to this branch of
expreffion, but likewiſe to ſhow that Emphaſis ſhould
be founded on reaſon, not laid merely for a gingle
or variation of ſound. Having thus marked and ex-
plained one ſtanza, I ſhall propoſe two more for the
exerciſe of the ſtudent.
He, as a curtain, ſtretch'd on high
The vaſt cerulean canopy,
And gave with fires to glow :
'Twas he, tremendous potentate!
Built on the waves his hall of ſtate,
Wide as the waters flow.
He walks upon the wings of wind,
And leaves the rapid ſtorms behind;
Their monarch's awful will

Seraphs await in dread fufpenſe,
And, fwifter than the lightning's glance,
His mighty word fulfil.
After all that can be faid, the degrees of Emphaſis
ale to many and fo variable, that no preciſe rules
cuill be laid down for their application.- In Reading
and Declamation, as in Muſic, there must be taite to
give beauty; without it, mere rectitude will be moſt
unaffectingly infipid. This quality, though improve-
able, mult certainly be firſt derived from nature.-
A Reader, before he can reach bare propriety, mutt
thoroughly underitand what he reads ; for which
reaſon the custom of putting children to read the
Bible, in which there are many difficult words and
abstruſe patlages, is ty no means to be commended;
nay, if we conſider it in another light, it is highly
blameable; for by being made the ſubject of puzzle
and embarrafiment, by being toiled about in a care-
leis flovenly manner, ihit love and reſpect which
the Sacred Writings jurily claim, is too frequently
fet alide in youth. We are told that among the
Turks, if a piece of written paper appears on the
ground, it is taken up and carefully preterved, leit
the word ALLAH, or God, be infcribed on it.- Mark
the contraſtic veneration of Chriſtians! who not
only profane with their mouths that most awful
name upon the moſt trivial occafions, but alſo fre-
quently uſe, as walte paper, whole ſheets in which
not only his facred name is frequently mentioned,
but erery letter is a part of his Divine word.
Another reaſon againit making the Bible an early
hook among learners, is the frequency of periods,
uud peculiarity of style, in which it differs widely
from most other books. It is not rare to find many
pertons uho, by laboriouſly conning over the chap-
teis, can itumble their way pretty tolerably through
:-105 part of it: yet put them to any other book, you
Thill find them lamentably hampered, and frequently
acabiolute itand.

But to return more particularly to my ſubject...
As no abſolute rules can be laid down for Emphaſis
in general, we muſt be content with remarks upon
particular caſes; ſuch as that Oppoſition, or Anti-
theſis, requires Emphaſis upon each of the oppoſed
words; and that most monofyllables beginning a
queſtion, muit be ſtrongly marked; as, why did he fo?
What can he mean? How did the look? In con-
pound words that are oppoſed to others, the Emphr-
dis
, or rather Accent, properly falls on the dif-
tinguiſhing ſyllables; for inſtance: the virtuous are
modeft—the vicious im-modeft--the righteous are blev
ed—the un-righteous are miferable. --Here I have
oppoſed ſimple to ſimple, and compound to com-
pound; were the words im-modeſt and un-righteous
to be pronounced without oppofition, the accent
would fall upon the ſecond ſyllable inſtead of the
In Explanatory Emphafis the very fame words are
differently marked according to the writer's defign ;
as, What did my maſter ſay? If I lay the ſtreſs upon
what, it is a general interrogation; if I place it
upon my, it implies that other matters were con-
cerned; if maſter is diſtinguiſhed, it notes that there
were other perſons; and if the Emphalis lies boideit
upon ſay, it ſhows I want to know his particular
words.
Both the cauſe and the effect in any ſentence re-
quire Emphaſis.--Example: To live well, is to
die HAPPY---only to be goon, is to be GREAT.
CLIMAX is that progreflive force and exaltation of
expreſſion, which more powerfully impreſſes the lui-
ject on the inind; and is not only of indiſpenſible
uſe, but alſo highly ornamental. In the execution
of this there is much nicety,as the rife, in most caſes,
should be gradual, always tuneable, and upon many
occafions
very
forcible. To illustrate the matter, I
fhall offer ſeveral examples of different degrees of
Climax.-Firſt from Shake peare's Brutus, which

and dignity

if theſe,
As I am ſure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards, and to ſteel with valour
The melting fp'rits of women; then, countrymen,
What need we any ſpur but our own cauſe
To prick us to redreſs ? What other bond,
Than ſecret Romans who have ſpoke the word
And will not falter? Or what other oath,
Than honeſty to honeſty engag'd,
That this ſhall be, or we will fall for it?
The Climax of Reafoning, in theſe lines, is too
obvious to be inſiſted on ; therefore I hall only ob-
ferve, that the glow of Expreſſion, as I may call it,
ſhould warm with the argument; and then proceed
to give another example from Addiſon, which calls
for dignity, ſoftened and impaflioned Ly the moſt
pathetic feeling of manly grief ; a feeling which
very few have imagination to conceive happily, and
as few powers to expreſs properly.
-'Tis Rome demands our tears ;

The nurſe of heroes ! the delight of Gods!
That humbled the proud tyrants of the earth,
And ſet the nations free- Rome is no more.

Cæſar's:
For him the ſelf-devoted Decii died;
The Fabii fell, and the great Scipios conquered;
Even Pompey fought for Cæfar: Oh, my friends,
How is the work of fate, the toil of ages,
The Roman empire, fall’n!-Oh curſt ambition !
Fallen into Cæfar's hands! Our great forefathers
Had left him nought to conquer but his country.

The following Paſſage from Otway. should gra-
dually warm into Rapture.
Can there in woman be ſuch glorious faith!
Sure all ill ſtories of thy ſex are falſe !
Oh woman! lovely woman! nature made thee
To temper man: we had been brutes without you:
Angels are painted fair to look like you:
There's in you all that we believe of heaven,
Amazing brightneſs, purity, and truth,
Eternal joy, and everlaſting love.
An Inſtance of Climax in vindistive Rage, we
have in the following lines of Young.
Yet, e'er I fall, be it one part
of vengeance,
To make even thee confeſs that I am juſt :
Thou ſeeſt a prince whoſe father thou haſt flain,
Whoſe native country thou haſt laid in blood,
Whoſe facred perſon—Oh, thou haft profan'd!
Whoſe reign extinguiſh’d. What was left to me
So highly born? no kingdom, but revenge ;
No treaſure, but thy tortures and thy groans.
A Climax of jealous Rage, Shakeſpeare gives us in
the following lines.
I had been happy if the general camp,
(Pioneers and all) had taſted her ſweet body,
So I had nothing known.-Oh now,
for ever
Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content !
Farewell the plumed troops, and the big war
That make ainbition virtue! Oh farewell!
Farewell the neighing iteed, and the Thrill trump;
The ſpirit-ſtirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner; and all quality,
Pride, pomp, and circumſtance of glorious war !
And, oh, ye mortal engines, whoſe rude throats
Th’ immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,
Farewell ! Othello's occupation's gone.

A Climax of more Rapidity, proceeding from a ſud-
den Burſt of Grief, Shakeſpeare gives as follows.
Come ſhew ine what thou'lt do ;
Woo't weep? Woo't faſt? Woo't fight? Woo't
tear thyſelf?
Woo't drink up Eiſel, eat a crocodile?
I'll do't.--Doſt thou come hither but to whine ?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and ſo will I';
And if thou prat'ſt of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing its pate againſt the burning zone,
Make Ofla like a wart.
Any perſon who can do juſtice to thełe, or ſimilar
paflages, either by genius or inſtruction, may claim
a fufficient knowledge of Climax; which however,
as well as Emphaſis, is farther explained under the
term MODULATION.
If we conſider the human voice through the whole
extent of its ſeveral divifions, we ſhall eaſily diſcover
that nothing can require more of the aſſiſtance of
art to render it pleaſing and expreſſive.
· The art of harmonious Expreſfion is diftinguiſhed
by the term modulation; for the better coinprehend-
ing of which let us borrow a diviſion from Mulic;
Counter Tenor, Tenor, and Baſe; or Upper, Me-
dium, and Lower Notes. Every one of theſe, ſo
far as Reading and Declamation extend, may be
found or created, more or lefs perfectly, in every
voice, according to the organs of utterance, and the
proper uſe of thoſe organs; it then remains properly
to appropriate each of the diviſions.
To all plaintive, amorous paftages, humble infi-
puation, Hattery, and frequently to exclamations of

Oh, Belvidera! doubly I'm a beggar;
Undone by fortune, and in debt to thee;
Want, worldly want, that hungry meagre fiend,
Is at my heels, and chaſes me in view.
Canſt thou bear cold and hunger? Can theſe limbs
Fram'd for the tender offices of love,
Endure the bitter gripes of ſinarting poverty?
When baniſh'd by our miſeries abroad,
(As ſuddenly we ſhall be) to ſeek out
In ſome far climate, where our names are ſtrangers,
For charitable ſuccour ;-wilt thou then,
When in a bed of ſtraw we ſhrink together,
And the bleak winds ſhall whiſtle round our heads,
Wilt thou then talk thus to me? Wilt thou then
Huſh my cares thus, and ſhelter me with love?
Inſtance of the amorous Style, from Lee.
-No more of this, no more ; for I diſdain
All
pomp when thou art by. Far be the noiſe
Of kings and courts from us, whoſe gentle ſouls
Our kinder ſtars have ſteer'd another
way.
Free as the foreſt-birds, we'll pair together,
Without rememb’ring who our fathers were ;
Fly to the arbours, grots, and flow’ry meads,
And in ſoft murmurs interchange our ſouls ;
Together drink the chryftal of the itream,
Or taſte the yellow fruit which Autumn yields ;
And, when the golden ev’ning calls us home,
Wing to our downy neſt, and ſleep till morn.
Humility and Infonuation are thus happily ſet forth
by Shakeſpeare.
Thus, Brutus, did my maſter bid me kneel;
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,
And, being proftrate, thus he bid me’ ſay:
Brutus is noble, valiant, wiſe, and honeil ;
Cæſar was mighty, royal, bold, and loving :
Say I love Brutus, and I honour him ;
Say I fear'd Cæſar, honour'd himn and lov'd hiin.

If Brutus will vouchſafe that Antony
May ſafely come to hiin, and be reſolv'd
How Cæſar hath deferv’d to lie in death,
Mark Antony ſhall not love Cæſar dead
So well as Brutus living; but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus,
Thorough the hazards of this untrod ſtate,
With all true faith.
Diffimulation, which requires the ſame tone of Ex-
preſion, we find in theſe lines of Young.
It hurts not not me, my lord, but as I love
you;
Warmly as you, I with Don Carlos well.
But I am likewiſe Don Alonzo's friend:
There all the difference lies between us two.
In me, my lord, you hear another ſelf,
And, give me leave to add, a better too;
Cleard from thoſe errors, which, tho’born of virtue,
Are ſuch as may hereafter give you pain. ---
Inſtances of Exclamation in Joy and Rage are thus
ſet forth by Shakeſpeare.
-Oh my foul's joy!
If after every tempeſt come ſuch calms,
May the winds blow till they have wakend death ;
And let the lab'ring bark climb hills of ſeas

Declamation which do not touch upon the paſſions.
I preſume it would be deemed fuperfluous to give
various examples of what every book, which preſents
itſelf for peruſal, calls for in general; therefore I
ſhall only tranſcribe one ſhort paſſage from Milton for
the medium notes.
-Know, that in the foul
Are many leſſer faculties, that ſerve
Reaſon as chief: among theſe fancy next
Her office holds : of all external things
Which the five watchful ſenſes repreſent,
She forms imagination's airy ſhapes,
Which reaſon joining or disjoining, frames
All what we affirm, or what deny, and call
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
Into her private cell, where nature reſts.
Oft in her abſence mimic fancy wakes
To imitate her ; but misjoining ſhapes
Wild work produces oft, and moſt in dreams,
Ill matching words and deeds, long paſt or late.
That degree of Expreſſion I term baſe, is particu-
farly well applied to gloomy meditation, partages of
horror, the invocation of fiends, cynical roughneſs,
and vindictive rage.--Inſtance of gloomy reflection,
from Young.
Whether firſt nature, or long want of peace;
Has wrought my mind to this, I cannot tell ;
But horrors now are not diſpleaſing to me:
I like this rocking of the battlements :
Rage on ye winds, burſt clouds, and waters roar!
Ye bear a juſt reſemblance of my fortune,
And ſuit the gloomy habit of my ſoul.

The cheerful day was every where ſhut out
With

and left a more than midnight darkneſs,
Such as might ev'n be felt: a few dim lamps,
That feebly lifted up their fickly heads,

More diſmal by ſuch light; while thoſe who waited

Thy whips, ſnakes, mortal ſtings, thy hoſt of hor..

Invocation of Fiends, from Young.
Ye pow'rs of darkneſs who rejoice in ill,
All ſworn by Styx, with peftilential blaſts
To wither every virtue in the bud;
To keep the door of dark conſpiracy,

I tell thee, ſlave, I have ſhook hands with hope,
And all my thoughts are rage, deſpair, and horror.
Theſe lines of the ſame Author preſent us with
cynical Roughneſs and Contempt.
Yes, thou haſt thy fex's virtues ;
Their affectation, pride, ill-nature, noiſe,
Proneneſs to change even from the joy that pleaſed
them;
So gracious is your idol, dear variety,
That for another love, you would forego
An angel's form, to mingle with a devil's.
Having thus given examples for each of the three
diviſions of voice, it becomes neceſſary to remark that
the variations in each are many; and that the appro-
priations I have made are only meant in general. There
are certainly ſeveral exceptions ; but theſe must be
left to the inſtructor's or ſtudent's diſcernment, as en-
tering into every particular would be, if not im-
practicable, at leaſt intolerably tedious.
Pauses next preſent themſelves to conſideration,
and chiefly occur in meditation, doubt, or confufion :
No exact time can be fixed for them, but they ought
to be made longer or ſhorter according to the impor-
tance of the ſubject; and in moſt, eſpecially paffages
of reflection, the voice ſhould have a tone of conti-
nuance, which conſtitutes the difference between a
Pauſe and Break; the former is a gradual ſtop, the
latter a ſudden check of Expreſſion.
Pauſes of the firſt fort occur in the following lines
of Shakeſpeare; and, as the ſubject is of great weight,
ſhould be of conſiderable duration, perhaps while one
could number fix, or a period and a half to each.

It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
And that craves wary walking: crown him-that-

Or theſe lines, from the fame Author.
To be or not to bethat is the queſtion:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to fuffer
The flings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms againſt a ſea of troubles,

rub:
For in that ſleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have ſhuffled off this mortal coil,
Mut give us pauſe.
Pauſes of confuſion are ſhorter than thoſe of reflec-
tion, and are to be filled up with heſitative panting
draughts of breath, while every ſucceeding word or
ſentence varies in tone of expreſſion from the former;
Inſtances from Shakeſpeare, as follow.

I think ſhe ſtirs again-10-what's the beſt -
Every diſcerning Reader will readily perceive that
the latter example is of a ſtronger but flower confufion
than the former.
BREAKS, as I have before hinted, are only Pauſes
of a different nature, more abrupt and ſudden, as
when a paffage cuts ſhort before the meaning is fully
explained: theſe moft frequently occur ir violent
grief and imperuous rage, and the tone of voice alters
as the paſſion riſes or falls. One general rule in the
expreſſion of grief is, that, when gradual, the tones
ſhould ſwell pathetically; but, when ſudden, they
fhould burſt forth and break the voice, ſtill avoiding
any diffonant ſcream or croak.-In theſe lines of
Shakeſpeare we find Pauſes of grief ſwelling flowly, and
working upon themſelves.
I pr’ythee, daughter, do not make me mad !
I will not trouble thee, my child--farewell.
We'll meet no more--no more ſee one another ;---

Nor tell tales of thee to avenging Heav'n :

Would with his daughter ſpeak :-Commands her
ſervice.
Are they inform'd of this? - My breath and blood-
Fiery—the fiery duke !--tell the hot duke that
No-but not yet, may be he is not well.-
Having thus particularly and diſtinctly explained
the Pauſe and application of the three grand diviſions
of the voice, in order to bring what has been ſaid into
a narrow compaſs, and to place it in one point of
view, I ſhall produce for an example the Seven
Ages of Shakeſpeare, and mark the lines according to
the variations; which, agreeably to the foregoing
obſervations, ought to be made in ſpeaking or in
reading this paſſage. The Counter Tenor, or upper
notes, I diſtinguiſh by Italics; the Tenor, or me-
dium, retain the common type, and the Baſe is
marked by CAPITALS.
AL world's a ſtage,
And all the men and women merely players ;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And each man in his time plays many parts ;
His acts being ſeven ages. Firſt the infant,
Mevling and perking in the nurſe's arms:
And then the whining ſchool-boy, with his fatchel
And fining morning fcce, creeping, like a ſna'l,
Unwillingly to fobool: - And then the lover,
Sighing, like furnace, with a woful ballad
Made to his miſtreſs' ryc-brow:-Then a ſoldier,
Full of ſtrange oaths, and bearded like a pard ;
Jealous in honour-ſudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Ev’n in the cannon's mouth: And then the JUSTICE,
IN FAIR
LIN'D,
WITH EYES SEVERE, AND BEARD OF FORMAL
CUT,
FULL OF WISE SAWS AND MODERN INSTANCES;
And ſo he plays his part : The fixth age ſhifts
Into the lean and ſlipper'd pantaloon ;
With ſpectacles on noſe, and pouch on ſide;
Ilis youthful hoſe, well ſav'il, a world too wide

For his forunik Mank; and his big manly voice
Turning again towards childiſh treble, pipes
And whiſtles in the found.-Laſt ſcene of all,
Which ends this ſtrange eventful hiſtory,
Is ſecond childiſhneſs and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, fans eyes, fans tafte, fans every thing.
Every Emphafis and variation of voice ſhould be
founded on reaſon; it may be proper therefore to
ſhow why the ſeveral parts of the preceding lines are
thus diſtinguiſhed. In the firſt age of infancy the
upper notes are moſt deſcriptive of that tender time,
as they are alſo of the whimpering ſchool-boy, and
their ſoftneſs likewiſe ſuits the fighing of the lover.
The forward confidence of the foldier demands a full-
ſpirited Medium ; and the corpulent importance gene-
rally imputed to magiftracy is well pictured by the
jolly ſwell of the Baſe notes, while the feebleneſs of
faſt declining age calls for the Counter Tenor, tre-
mulated as it were with weakneſs.
Thus much for general explanation, which I have
delivered in as full and clear a manner as the nature
of my deſign will poſſibly admit; and having ſet
forth ſuch examples as, explained by teachers, or
carefully inveſtigated by ſtudents, may give a full
idea of what is intended, I fhall proceed to fome
brief remarks upon Utterance and Action, in which,
though it is not probable that many will excel, yet
moſt may be improved.
Firſt then, if a voice is naturally harſh, great care
ſhould be taken to avoid guttural expreſſion ; nor
ſhould the tongue be allowed to play too much be-
tween the teeth; the breath, drawn as it were from
the ſtomach, and vibrated upon within the mouth,
will ſoften harſh notes, and render them much more
tuneable; on the contrary, a weak ſhrill voice ſhould
borrow folidity and force from the throat; as too
great an expanſion of the lips is diſgraceful to the
features, fo an unnatural contraction of them will :
render expreſſion unireaning and imperfect.
Stops

Stops and Cadences are a moſt effential point of
confideration, and cannot be better ſet forth than in
the following remarks of a French author : “ It is
“ neceſſary for us," ſays he, “ to reſpire from time to
“ time, but the voice does not repoſe equally at the
“ concluſion of every ſenſe; in a ſentence of con-
fiderable length we reſpire at every comma ; but
“ this ſhort pauſe is made in ſuch a manner as to
" ſhow, by the tone of continuance, that we are to
go farther, the ear remaining unſatisfied, becauſe
" the pronunciation continues ſuſpended till the
6 ſentence is completely finiſhed; as for example:
“At ſuch a time, the king having taken theſe matters
" into confideration, determined, here-attention is inqui- ,
66 fitive to know what follows; the colon and ſemico-
" lon are marks of inore conſiderable reſpiration, yet
66 ſtill leave judgment in ſuſpenſe till the period un-
“ folds the whole, and calls for a concluding Cadence.
“ In every part or parts of a ſentence there is ele-
“ vation and depreſſion of the voice, which never
" abſolutely repoſes but at the concluſion of a
pe-
“ riod, all other reſpiration being of continuance."
There is undoubtedly much judgment in the com-
poſition of harmonious and comprehenſive periods ;
a diſſonant unconnected ſtyle will take greatly from
the beauty and force of expreſſion, as a diſcordant
piece of muſic muſt diſgrace the performance of the
ableſt maſter, and injure the utterance of the moſt
perfect inſtruments.
Frequent uſe ſtrengthens and meliorates the organs
of expreſſion, and practice will teach a moſt eſſential
point, that of pitching the voice to any place or num-
ber of perſons. There is conſiderable nicety in
knowing the different effect which the ſame notes of
voice may have in places of equal dimenfions, but
of different conſtruction, of a place containing but
few auditors, or thronged with a large number; and
this point of excellence muſt be attained by much
practice and obſervation. Only thus much inay be
obſerved in general of the operations of found; that
where it undulates conſiderably, the louder a Reader

or Declaimer goes beyond the juſt pitch, the more
indiſtinct he will be, of which we find very frequent
inſtances in cathedral churches : A full audience in
any place will require at leaſt twice the force of ex-
preſſion of a thin one; which, excluſive of ſome buzz
that muſt unavoidably attend a numerous aſſembly,
may be philoſophically accounted for by an effential
denſity of air, from the conjunct reſpiration of fo
many people.
The voice being pitched, and modulated through
the ſeveral variations which may be found neceffary,
it remains to conſider, to comprehend, and to feel
the ſubject; without which, expreſſion muſt be lan-
guid, unaffecting, and wearifome. What we read
or ſpeak unfelt, must be like painting without light
or ſhade; there may be juſt ſymmetry of parts and
good colouring; but unleſs they are raiſed and brought
forward, both pall on the view, and die upon the
canvaſs.
Spirit and feeling are neceſſary to idea as well as
to fight ; for which reaſon teachers ſhould not only
make their pupils underſtand every word they read,
but their general ſenſe in a ſtate of connection: a
point of care feldom attended to.
Emphatic expreſſion, feeling, and taſte, are par-
ticularly eſſential to poetry, as that, in general, ap.
peals oftner to the paſſions than any other ſpecies of
writing. Cadences alſo are more critical in numbers
than in proſe ; in both they ſhould be ſmooth, gra•
dual, and die away almoſt inſenſibly, yet ſo as to
preſerve and to impreſs the laft fyllable both upon the
ear and mind, without ſnapping ſhort the breath or
found, which is extremely grating to a judicious
hearer.
How miferably is verſe of every kind mangled ! A
fort of unmeaning pedantic recitative, tedious from
a repetition of miſplaced unharınonious tones, is
ſubſtituted for dignity ; thus we find many, who
make a tolerable ſhift with proſe, the moment they
ſee any number of meaſured ſyllables, throw afide
nature, reaſon, nay even conmon ſenſe, to diſplay
their

their knowledge of verſification, and what they think
its peculiar importance.
What can be more ab-
furd ? Genuine poetry needs no pompous affectation
to dignify it ; for as by tranſpoſing the words you
cannot reduce it to proſe, neither can you take from
its harmony by plain, natural expreffion.
I know not any thing which has done our lan-
guage, and the reading of it, more injury than the
gingle of rhime, eſpecially that which is thrown into
heroic meaſure ; it being certain that the more cor-
rect an author in that way is, the more he will lead
to monotony. Inſtance Mr. Pope, who has been
ſo critically exact in accenting particular fyllables,
that very few of his pieces can be read with any
tolerable variation of voice ; for which reaſon I would
have learners kept from rhime in heroic meaſure till
they are well grounded in a jutt mode of utterance.
Indeed we are not to wonder that the generality
chant verſe in ſo lamentable a manner, when ſome
of thoſe who have ſketched rules for reading inſiſt
upon ſuch a ſervile obedience to the author, as not
only to change che accented ſyllable, but even to
favour his bad rhime with falſe pronunciation : for
example, to found the laſt fyllable of liberty as an
exact rhime either to flec or fly. To preſcribe a ſtop
or half pauſe at the end of a line, whether the ſenſe
require it or not, is another rule that has been given,
equally erroneous and diſguſtful.
In Reading, properly ſo called, Action has no
concern, but Declamation is very defective without it;
yet, except upon the ſtage, and among many there
miſerably methodized, we ſcarce find any. When
I recommend Action, I would not be ſuppoſed to
intend that a ſpeaker ſhould be in continual motion;
or that, puppet-like, he is to lift up firit one hand
and then another, merely to lay them down again.--
No-I would have motions few, eaſy, graceful;
and, for my own part, I know not how a Declaimer
can poſſibly feel and ſtand ſtock-ſtill: but, admit the
poſſibility of this, I will venture to ſay there is but
little probability that his audience will think him in

earneſt. I know that fome delicate perſons are afraid
of becoming too theatrical; but there is a very wide
difference between the action of an orator and a
player, unleſs when the latter judiciouſly repreſents
the former ; but I ſhall no further urge the neceſſity
of a point 'fo obvious, let us proceed to the thing
itſelf.
Firſt then, Action ſhould be entirely reſerved for
thoſe paſſages which contain ſomewhat intereſting or
important, as Demonitration, or the enforcing of a
charge. This ſhould be attended with the right
arın ſtretched forward to the full extent, the fingers
even, and the palm of the hand downwards ; or ſome-
times the hand turned fideways, the forc-finger only
pointing : if the circumſtance demonſtrated, or given
in charge, be very momentous, the well-known
and admired action of St. Paul preaching at Athens,
ſtretching forth both arms, has much force and pro-
priety,
Where Grief is to be expreſſed, the right hand
laid flowly to the left breaſt, the head and cheſt bend-
ing forward, is a juſt indication of it. To expreſs
Confidence and Reſolution, the fame hand muſt
move to the fame place, but with quickneſs and
vigour, recoiling as it were from the heart, which
thereby ſeems to meet it: with this action the head
ſhould be thrown back and the cheſt forward. The
expreſſion of Ardent Affection, is to cloſe both hands
warinly at half arm's length, the fingers interming-
ling, and to bring them to the breaſt with fpirit.
If Expanſion of Mind, or any thing ſimilar, is to be
pointed out, then both arms ſhould be caſt different
ways in a parallel line, and the cheſt thrown open.
There are iome few other inſtances of Action which
inay be graceful, and ſerve for variation, though not
abſolutely neceffary; but theſe muſt be left to the
choice and diſcretion of the Declaimer, and to the
unconitrained operation of judicious feeling: Only
thus much it may be neceíſary to obſerve, that the
left hand ſhould feldom or never be uſed by itſelf ;
and that all action ſhould inove between the tip of
the

the ſhoulder and the ſeat of the heart ; all above is
what Shakeſpeare juſtly 1tyles fawing the air; all below,
both unmeaning and ungraceful. Upon the whole,
every
motion fhould be the natural attendant of what is
fpoken; if an extreme cannot be avoided, I would
rather recommend no action than too much, or than
fuch as muſt offend judicious eyes.- Attitudes, or
poſitions of the body, being chiefly adapted to thea-
trical performance, which lies without the compaſs
of my work, I ſhall ſay no more of them than that
they are pleafingly pictureſque and itriking when
avell executed.
From there confiderations it reſts upon me to re-
commend and requeit, that every Reader will digeſt
as well as peruſe; and that Inſtructors will make
themſelves ſo much maſters of the variations relative
to voice and geiture, ſo as to explain and illuſtrate
the principles by their immediate example. Expe-
rience has verified the good effects this ſhort Eſſay
may have, if coolly and carefully attended to; and
this trial I hope it has a right to expect.
Thus I have touched upon all the points purpoſed
in my original deſign, and could have ſaid much
more upon every one of them ; but flattering myſelf
I have been fufficiently explicit and extenfive for
the character of an aſſiſtant, I reſt the whole upon
candor and public opinion; highly pleaſed if my
endeavours to be uſeful ſhould fucceed; and eaſy,
as not being the firſt, if I have failed in the attempt.

we promiſe, we threaten, we diſmiſs, we invite, we
intreat, we expreſs averfion, fear, doubting, denial,
aſking, affirmation, negation, joy, grief, confefficn,
penitence. With the hands we deſcribe, and point
out all circumſtances of time, place, and manner of
what we relate; we excite the paſſions of others and
footh them; we approve and diſapprove, permit or
prohibit, admire or deſpiſe. The hands ſerve us in-
ſtead of many ſorts of words; and where the lan-
guage of the tongue is unknown, that of the hands
is underſtood, being univerſal, and common to all
nations.
The legs advance, or retreat, to expreſs deſire or
averſion, love or hatred, courage or fear, and pro-
duce exultation, or leaping in ſudden joy; and the
ſtamping of the foot expreſſes earneſtneſs, anger, and
threatening.
Eſpecially the face, being furniſhed with a variety
of muſcles, does more in expreſſing the pallions of
the mind than the whole human frame beſides. The
change of colour (in white people) ſhews, by turns,
anger by redneſs, and ſometimes by paleneſs; fear
likewiſe by paleneſs, and ſhame by bluſhing. Every
feature contributes its part.
The mouth open,
Thews one ſtate of the mind, fhut, another; the
gnaſhing of the teeth, another. The forehead ſmoothi,
and eyebrows arched and eaſy, ſhew tranquillity or
joy. 'Mirth opens the mouth toward the ears, criſps
the noſe, half-ſhuts the eyes, and ſometimes fills
them with tears. The front wrinkled into frowns,
and the eyebrows over-hanging the eyes, like clouds
fraught with tempeſt, ſhew a mind agitated with fury.
Above all, the eye ſhews the very fpirit in a viſible
form. In every different ſtate of the mind it aflumes
a different

a different appearance. Joy brightens and opens it;
grief half-cloſes and drowns it in tears. Love darts
from it in glances like the orient beam. Hatred and
anger flaſh from it like lightning. Jealouſy and
ſquinting envy dart their contagious blaſts at the
eye ; and devotion raiſes it to the ſkies, as if the
foul of the holy man were going to take its flight to
heaven.
The Ancients uſed fome Geſtures which are un-
known to us ; as, to expreſs grief and other violent
emotions of the mind, they uſed to ſtrike their knees
with the palms of their hands.
The force of attitude and looks alone appears in a
wonderouſly ſtriking manner in the works of the
painter and ſtatuary, who have the delicate art of
making the flat canvaſs and rocky marble utter every
paſſion of the human mind, and touch the ſoul of
the ſpectator, as if the picture, or ſtatue, ſpoke the
pathetic language of Shakeſpeare. It is no wonder
then that matterly action, joined with powerful elo-
cution, ſhould be irreſistible : and the variety of
expreſſion by looks and geſtures is ſo great, that, as is
well known, a whole play can be repreſented without
a word ſpoken.
The following are, I believe, the principal paffions,
humours, ſentiments, and intentions, which are to
be expreſſed by ſpeech and action; and I hope it
will be allowed by the Reader that it is nearly in
the following manner that nature expreſſes them.
TRANQUILLITY, or APATHY, appears by the
compoſure of the countenance, and general repoſe
of the body and limbs, without the exertion of any
one muſcle. The countenance open, the forehead
ſinooth, the eyebrows arched, the mouth juſt not
Thut, and the eyes paſſing with an eaſy motion from
object to object, but not dwelling long upon any one.
CHEERFULNESS adds a ſmile, opening the mouth
a little more.
MIRTH, or LAUGHTER, opens the mouth ſtill
more toward the ears, criſps the poſe, leſſens the
с
aperture

aperture of the eyes, and fometimes fills them with
tears, ſhakes and convulſes the whole frame, giving
conſiderable pain, which occaſions holding the fides.
RAILLERY, in ſport, without real animoſity,
puts on the aſpect of cheerfulneſs; the tone of voice
is fprightly. With contempt or diſgust it caſts a
look afquint, from time to time, at the object, and
quits the cheerful aſpect for one mixed between an
affected grin and fourneſs; the upper lip is drawn
up with an air of diſdain; the arms are ſet a-kimbo
on the hips, and the right hand now and then
thrown out toward the object, as if one were going
to ſtrike another a ſlight back-hand blow; the pitch
of the voice rather loud, the tone arch and ſneering ;
the ſentences ſhort ; the expreffions ſatirical, with
mock-praiſe intermixed.
BuFroonery affumes an arch, fly, leering gra-
vity; muſt not quit its ſerious aſpect, though all
ſhould be laughing round it. This command of
face is ſomewhat difficult, though not ſo hard as to
reſtrain the contrary ſympathy, that of weeping with
Joy, when ſudden and violent, expreſſes itſelf by
clapping of hands, and exultation, or leaping. The
eyes are opened wide, perhaps filled with tears, often
raiſed to heaven, eſpecially by devout perfons. The
countenance is ſmiling, not compoſedly, but with
features aggravated. The voice riſes, from time to
time, to very high notes.
DELIGHT, or PLEASURE, as when one is enter-
tained or raviſhed with mufic, painting, oratory, or
any ſuch elegancy, ſhews itſelf by the looks, geſtures,
and utterance of joy; but moderated. (See Joy).
Gravity, or SERIOUSNESS, the mind fixed
upon ſome important fubject, draws down the eye-
brows a little ; caſts down, or ſhuts, or raiſes the
eyes
to heaven; ſhuts the mouth, and pinches the lips
cloſe. The poſture of the body and limbs is com-
poſed, and without much motion. The ſpeech, if
any, flow and ſolemn, the tone unvarying.
INQUIRY into an obſcure ſubject fixes the body

in one poſture, the head ſtooping and the eye poring,
the eyebrows drawn down.
ATTENTION to an elteerned or ſuperior character
has the ſame aſpect, and requires ſilence; the eyes
often, caſt down upon the ground, ſometimes fixed
on the face of the speaker, but not too perily.
MODESTY, or SUBMISSION, bends the lody for-
ward; levels the eyes to the breaſt, if not to the
feet, of the ſuperior character. The voice low, the
tone ſubmiſſive, and words few.
PERPLEXITY, or ANXIETY, which is always at-
tended with ſome degree of fear and uneaſineſs, draws
all the parts of the body together; gathers up the
arms upon the breaſt, unleſs one hand covers the
eyes, or rubs the forehead; draws down the eyebrows;
hangs the head upon the breaſt; caſts down the eyes,
ſhuts and pinches the eyelids cloſe; ſhuts the mouth,
and pinches the lips cloſe, or bites them. Suddenly
the whole body is vehemently agitated; the erfon
walks about buſily, ſtops abruptly; he talks to him-
ſelf, or makes grimaces; if he ſpeaks to another,
his pauſes are very long, the tone of his voice unvarying,
and his ſentences broken, expreſſing half, and keep-
ing in half of what ariſes in his mind.
VEXATION, occafioned by fome real or imaginary
misfortune, agitates the whole frame; and beſides
exprefling itſelf with the looks, geſtures, reſtleſliefs
and tone of perplexity, it adds complaint, fretting,
and lamenting.
Pity, a mixed paflion of love and grief, looks
down upon diſtreſs with lifted hands, eyebrows drawn
down, mouth open, and features drawn together.
Its expreſſion, as to looks and geſture, is the ſame
with thoſe of Suffering, (ſee SUFFERING) but more
moderate, as the painful feelings are only ſympa-
thetic, and therefore one remove, as it were, more
diſtant from the foul, than what one feels in his own
perfon.
GRIEF, ſudden and violent, expreſſes itſelf by
beating the head, grovelling on the ground, tearing
of garments, hair, and Heih, ſtreaming aloud, weep-
ing,

ing, ſtamping with the feet, lifting the eyes, from
time to time, to heaven; hurrying to and fro, run-
ning «iſtracted, or fainting away, ſometimes without
recovery. Sometimes violent grief produces a torpid
ſullen ſilence, reſembling total apathy.
MELANCHOLY, or fixed grief, is gloomy, ſedentary,
motionleſs. The lower jaw falls, the lips pale, the
eyes are caſt down half ſhut, eyelids ſwelled and red,
or livid, tears trickling ſilent, and unwiped ; with a
total inattention to every thing that pafles. Words,
if any, few, and thoſe dragged out rather than ſpoken;
the accents weak and interrupted, fighs breaking into
the middle of ſentences and words.
DESPAIR, as in a condemned criminal, or one
who has loſt all hope of ſalvation, bends the eyebrows
downward, clouds the forehead, rolls the eyes around
frightfully, opens the mouth toward the ears, bites
the lips, widens the noſtrils, gnaſhes with the teeth
like a fierce wild beaſt. The heart is too much
hardened to ſuffer tears to flow ; yet the eyeballs will
be red and inflamed like thoſe of an animal in a
rabid ſtate. The head is hung down upon the breast;
the arms are bended at the elbows; the fiſts clinched
hard ; the veins and muſcles ſwelled; the ſkin livid;
and the whole body ſtrained and violently agitated;
groans, expreſſive of inward torture, more frequently
uttered than words; if any words, they are few,
and expreſſed with a fullen, eiger bitterneſs, the
tone of voice often loud and furious :
as it often
drives people to diſtraction and ſelf-murder, it can
hardly te over-acted by one who would repreſent it.
FEAR, violent and ſudden, opens very wide the
eyes and mouth; ſhortens the nole; draws down the
eyebrows; gives the countenance an air of wildneſs ;
covers it with deadly paleneſs; draws back the elbows
parallel with the fides: lifts up the open hands, the
fingers together, to the height of the breaſt, ſo
that the palms face the dreaded object, as thields
oppoſed againſt it. One foot is drawn back tehind
the other, ſo that the body feems fhrinking from
the danger, and putting itſelf in a poſture for fight.

The heart beats violently, the breath is fetched
quick and ſhort; the whole body is thrown into a
general tremor. The voice is weak and trembling;
the ſentences are ſhort
, and the meaning confuſed
and incoherent. Imminent danger, real or fancied,
produces in timorous perſons, as women and chil,
dren, violent (hrieks, without any articulate found
of words; and ſometimes irrecoverably confounds
the underitanding, produces fainting, which is fome-
times followed by death.
SHAME, or a ſenſe of one's appearing to a diſad-
vantage before one's fellow-creatures, turns away the
fiice from the beholders ; covers it with bluſhes ;
hangs the head; caſts down the eyes ; draws down
the eyebrows; either ſtrikes the perſon dumb, or,
if he attempts to ſay any thing in his own defence,
cauſes his tongue to faulter, and confounds his utter-
ance, and puts him upon making a thouſand geſtures
and grimaces to keep himſelf in countenance; all
which only heighten the confuſion of his appear-
ance.
REMORSE, or a painful ſenſe of guilt, caſts down
the countenance, and clouds it with anxiety; hangs
down the head, draws the eyebrows down upon the
eyes. The right hand beats the breaſt; the teeth
gnaſh with anguish: the whole body is ſtrained and
violently agitated. If this ſtrong remorſe is ſucceed-
ed by the more gracious difpofition of penitence or
contrition, then the eyes are raiſed (but with great
appearance of doubting and fear) to the throne of
mercy, and immediately caſt down again to the
earth; then floods of tears are ſeen to flow ; the
knees are bended, or the body proſtrated on the
ground; the arms are ſpread in a ſuppliant potture,
and the voice of deprecation is uttered with fighs,
groans, timidity, heſitation, and trembling.
COURAGE, ſteady and cool, opens the counte-
nance, gives the whole form an erect and graceful
air; the accents are ſtrong, full-mouthed, and arti-
culate; the voice firin and even.

BOAST-

BOASTING, or affected courage, is loud, bluster-
ing, threatening; the eyes ftare, the eyebrows drawn
down, the face is red and bloated, the mouth pouts
out, the voice hollow and thundering, the arms are
fet a-kimbo, the head often nodding in a menacing
manner, and the right filt, clinched, is brandiſhed,
from time to time, at the perſon threatened ; the
right foot is often ttamped upon the ground, and the
legs take ſuch large itrides, and the ſteps are ſo
heavy, that the earth ſeems to tremble under them.
PRIDE affumes a lofty look, bordering upon the
afpect and attitude of Anger. The eyes open, but
with the eyebrows conſiderably drawn do:vn, the
mouth pouting out, or fhut, and the lips pinched
clore. The words walk out a-ſtrut, with a flow,
itiff, bombaſtic affectation of importance; the arıns
generally a-kimbo, and the legs at a diſtance from
one another, taking large tragedy ſtrides.
OBSTINACY adds to the alpect of Pride a dogged
fournets, like that of Malice. (See MALICE.)
AUTHORITY opens the countenance, but draws
down the eyebrows a little, ſo far as to give the
look of Gravity. (See GRAVITY.)
COMMANDING requires an air a little more pe-
remptory, with a look a little levere or ftern. The
· hand is held out, and moved toward the perſon to
whom the order is given, with the palm upwards,
and ihe head nods toward him.
FORBIDDING, on the contrary, draws the head
backward, and puſhes the hand from one with the
palm downwards, as if going to lay it upon the per-
ion to hold him down inmoveable, that he may not
do what is forbidden him.
AFFIRMING, eſpecially with an oath, is exprefled
by lifting the open right hand, and eyes toward
heaven; or, if conſcience is appealed to, by laying
the right hand upon the breaſt.
DENYING is exprefled by puſhing the open right
hand from one, and turning the face the contrary
way. (See AVERSION.)

DIFTERING in ſentiment may be expreffed as Re-
fufing. (See REFUSING.)
AGREEING in opinion, or conviction, as Grant-
ing. (See GRANTING.);
EXHORTING, as by a general at the head of his
arny, requires a kind, complacent look, unleſs inat-
ter of offence has paſſed, as neglect of duty, or the
like.
JUDGING demands a grave, ſteady look, with deep
attention ; the countenance altogether clear from any
appearance of either diſguſt or favour ; the accents
flow, diſtinct, emphatical, accompanied with little
action, and that very grave.
REPROVING puts on a ſtern aſpect, roughens the
voice, and is accompanied with geſtures not much
different from thoſe of threatening, but not fo lively.
ACQUITTING is performed with a benevolent,
tranquil countenance and tone of voice; the right
hand, if not both, open, waved gently toward the
perſon acquitted, expreffing diſmiffion. (See D18-
miss ING.)
CONDEMNING aſſumes a ſevere look, but mixed
with pity. The ſentence is to be expreffed as with
reluctance.
TEACHING, EXPLAINING, INCULCATING, or
giving orders to an inferior, requires an air of fupe-
riority to be aſſumed. The features are to be com-
poſed to an authoritative gravity; the eye ſteady and
open, the eyebrow a little drawn down over it, but
not ſo much as to look furly or dog matical; the tone
of voice varying according as the Emphaſis requires,
of which a good deal is neceſſary in expreffing matter
of this fort; the pitch of the voice to be ſtrong and
clear, the articulation diſtinct, the utterance flow,
and the manner peremptory. This is the proper
manner of pronouncing the commandments in the
communion office.
PARDONING differs from acquitting, in that the
latter nfeans clearing a perſon, after trial, of guilt;
whereas the former ſuppoſes guilt, and fignifies
merely delivering the guilty perſon from puniſhment.
Pardoning

Pardoning requires fome degree of ſeverity of aſpect
and tone of voice, becauſe the pardoned perſon is not
an object of entire unmixed approbation ; otherwiſe
its expreſſion is much the ſame as Granting. (See
GRANTING.)
ARGUING requires a cool, fedate, attentive aſpect,
and a clear, flow, emphatical accent, with much
demonſtration by the hand : it differs from Teaching,
(fee TEACHING) in that the look of authority is not
wanted in arguing.
DISMISSING, with approbation, is done with a
kind aſpect and tone of voice; the right hand, open,
gently waved toward the perſon. With diſpleature,
befides the look and tone of voice which ſuits diſplea-
fure, the hand is haftily thrown out toward the per-
ſon diſmiſſed, the back part toward him, the coun-
tenance at the ſame time turned away from him.
REFUSING, when accompanied with diſpleaſure,
is expreſſed nearly in the ſame way. Without dila
pleaſure, it is done with a viſible reluctance, which
occaſions the bringing out the words flowly, with
ſuch a fhake of the head and ſhrug of the ſhoulders,
as is natural upon hearing of ſomewhat which gives us

VENERATION, or WORSHIPPING, comprehends
ſeveral articles, as aſcription, confeſſion, reinorte,
interceſſion, thankſgiving, deprecation, petition, &c.
Aſcription of honour and praiſe to God, and con-
feffion and deprecation, are uttered with all that hu-
mility of looks and geſture, which can exhibit the
moſt profound ſelf-abaſement and annihilation, he-

down again, or cloſed for a moment; the eyebrows
are drawn down in the inoſt reſpectful manner; the
features, and the whole body and liinbs are all com-
poſed to the moſt profound gravity; one poiture
continuing, without conſiderable change, during the
whole performance of the duty. The knees bended,
or the whole body proſtrate, or if the poſture be
standing, which Scripture does not diſallow, bending
forward, as ready to proſtrate itſelf. The arms
ſpread out, but modeſtly, as high as the breaſt; the
hands open. The tone of the voice will be ſub-
millive,' timid, equal, trembling, weak, ſuppliant.
The words will be brought out with a viſible anxiety
and diffidence, approaching to heſitation ; few and
flow; nothing of vain repetition, haranguing, flowers
of rhetoric, or affected figures of ſpeech; all fimpli-
city, humility, and lowlineſs, ſuch as becomes a
reptile of the duſt, when preſuming to addreſs Him
greatneſs is tremendous beyond all created
conception. In interceflion for our fellow-creatures,
which is preſcribed in Scripture, and in thankſgiving,
the countenance will n-iturally aſſume a ſmall degree
of cheerfulneſs beyond what it was clothed with in
confeſſion of - fin, and deprecation of puniſhment:
but all affected ornament of ſpeech, or gelture in,
devotion, deſerves the ſevereſt cenſure, as being
fomewhat much worſe than abſurd.
Respect for a ſuperior puts on the looks and
geſture of Modeity. (See MODESTY.)
Hope brightens the countenance, arches the
eyebrows, gives the eyes an eager wiſhful look, opens
the mouth to half a linile; bends the body a little
forward, the feet equal; ſpreads the arins, with
the hands open, as to receive the object of its long-
ings; the tone of the voice is eager, and unev
evenly,
inclining to that of joy, but curbed by a degree of
doubt and anxiety. Delire differs from Hope, as
to expreſfion, in this particular, that there is more
appearance of doubt and anxiety in the former than
the latter; for it is one thing to delire what is agree-

able, and another to have a proſpect of actually ob-
taining it.
Desire expreffes itſelf by bending the body for-
ward, and ftretching the arms towards the object, as
to graſp it; the countenance ſmiling, but eager and
wiſhful; the eyes wide open, and eyebrows raiſed;
the mouth open ; the tone of voice fuppliant, but
lively and cheerful, unleſs there be distreſs as well
as deſire; the expreſſions fluent and copious ; if no
words are uſed, ſighs inſtead of them ; but this is
chiefly in distreſs.
Love (fuccefsful) lights up the countenance into
ſmiles; the forehead is ſmoothed and enlarged; the
eyebrows are arched ; the mouth a little open, and
ſmiling; the eyes languiſhing, and half-ſhut, dote
upon the beloved object. The countenance affumes
the eager and wiſhful look of Deſire. (See DESIRE.)
but mixed with an air of ſatisfaction and repoſe. The
accents are ſoft and winning; the tone of voice pera
fuafive, flattering, pathetic, various, muſical, rap-
turous, as in Joy. (See joy.) The attitude much
the ſame with that of Deſire; ſometimes both hands
preiling eagerly to the bofom. Love, unſucceſsful,
adds an a'r of Anxiety and Melancholy. (See PER-
PLEXITY and MELANCHOLY.)
GIVING, INVITING, SOLICITING, and ſuch-
like actions, which ſuppoſe fome degree of affection,
cal or pretended, are accompanied with much the
fame looks and geſtures as expreſs Love, but more
moderate.
WONDER, or AMAZEMENT, (without any
other
intereſting paffion, as Love, Eiteem, &c.) opens
the eyes, and makes them appear very prominent;
fometimes raiſes them to the ikies; but oftener, and
more expreſſively, fixes them on the object, if the
cauſe of the paiſion be a preſent and viſible object,
with the look, all except the wildneſs, of Fear.
(See FEAR.) If the hands hold any thing at the
time when the object of wonder appears, they imme-
diately let it drop, unconſcious, and the whole body
fixes in the contracted ſtooping poſture of Amaze-
ment ;

ment; the mouth open ; the hands held up open,
nearly in the attitude of Fear. (See FEAR.)
The
firſt acceſs of this paſſion ſtops all utterance; but it
- makes amends afterwards by a copious flow of words
and exclamations.
ADMIRATION, a mixed paſſion, conſiſting of
wonder, with love or eſteem, takes away the fami-
liar geſture and expreffion of fimple Love. See
LOVE.) Keeps the reſpectful look and attitude.
(See MODESTY and VENERATION.) The, eyes
are opened wide, and now and then 'raiſed toward
heaven; the mouth is opened; the hands are lifted
up; the tone of the voice rapturous. This paſſion
expreſſes itſelf copioufly, making great uſe of the
figure hyperbole.
GRATITUDE puts on an aſpect full of compla-
:cency: (See Love.) If the object of it is a cha-
racter greatly ſuperior, it expreſles much ſubmiſſion,
(See MODESTY.) The right hand preſſed upon the
breaſt accompanies, very properly, the expreſſion of a
fincere and hearty fenfibility of obligation.
CURIOSITY, as of a buſy-body, opens the eyes
and mouth, lengthens the neck, bends the body for-
ward, and fixes it in one poiture, with the hands
nearly in that of Admiration. (See ADMIRATION,
DESIRE, ATTENTION, HOPE, INQUIRY,
and PER-
PLEXITY.)
PERSUASION puts on the looks of moderate Love.
(See LOVE.) Its accents are ſoft, flattering, em-
phatical, and articulate.
TEMPTING, or WHEEDLING, expreſſes itſelf
much in the ſame way, only carrying the tawning
part to exceſs.
PROMISING is expreſſed with benevolent looks,
the nod of conſent, and the open hands gently mored
toward the perſon to whom the promile is made, the
palms upwards. The fincerity of the promiſer may
be exprefled by laying the right hand gently on the

tation of learning gives a ſtiff formality to the whole
perſon; the words come ſtalking out with the face
of a funeral proceſſion, and every ſentence has the
folemni:y of an oracle. Affectation of piety turkis
up the goggling whites of the eyes to heaven, as if
the perſon were in a trance, and fixes them in that
poſture ſo long, that the brain of the beholder grows
giddy : then comes up deep grumbling, a hollow groan
from the lower parts of the thorax ; but fo tremen-
dous in found, and ſo long protracted, that you ex-
pect to ſee a goblin riſe, like an exhalation through
the folid earth. Then he begins to rock from fide
to fide, or backward and forward, like an aged pine
on the ſide of a hill when a briik wind blow:; the
hands are claſped together, and often lifted, and
the head often ſhaken with fooliſh vehemence; the
-tone of the voice is canting, or fing-long lullaby,
not much diſtant from an Iriſh howl, and the words
godly doggrel. Affectation of beauty, and killing,
puts a fine woman, by turns, into all ſorts of forins,
appearances, and attitudes, but amiable ones : fhe
undoes by art, or rather by au kwardneſs, (for true
art conceals itſelf) all that nature had done for her.
Nature formed her alınoſt an angel, and the, with
infinite pains, makes herſelf a monkey; therefore
this ſpecies of Affectation is eaſily iinitated or taken

Affectation to the life.

FATIGUE, from ſevere labour, gives a general

body, if fitting or lying along be not the poſture,
ſtoops, as in old age. (See DOTAGE.) The legs,

Courage.
JEALOUSY is a ferment of Love, Hatred, Hope,
Fear, Shame, Anxiety, Sufpicion, Grief, Pity, Envy,
Pride, Rage, Cruelty, Vengeance, Madneſs, and
if there be any other tormenting paſſion which can
agitate the human mind; therefore to expreſs Jea-
louſy well, requires that one know how to repreſent
juftiy all theſe paſſions by turns, (See Love, HA-
TRED, &c.) and often ſeveral of them together.
Jealouſy thews itſelf by reſtleſſneſs, peeviſhneſs,
thoughtfulneſs, anxiety, abſence of mind. Some
times it burſts out in piteous complaint and weep-
ing; then a gleam of hope, that all is yet well, lights
up the countenance into a momentary ſinile. Ime
mediately the face, clouded with a general gloom,
ſhews the mind overcait again with horrid fufpicions
and frightful imaginations.
Then the arins are
folded upon the breaſt; the fifts violently clinched;
the rolling, bloody eyes dart fury. He hurries to
and fro; he has no more reit than a ſhip in a
troubled ſea, the ſport of winds and waves. Again
he compoſes himſelf a little, to reflect on the charms
of the ſuſpected perſon; the appears to his imagi-
nation like the ſweetneſs of the riſing dawn; then
his moniter-breeding fancy repreſents her as falle
as ſhe is fair; then he roars out as one on the rack,
when the cruel engine rends every joint, and every
finew burſts: then he throws himſelf on the ground;
he beats his head againſt the pavement; then he
ſprings up, and with the look and action of a fury
burſting hot from the abyſs, he fuatches the inſtru-
ment of death, and, after ripping up the boſom of
the loved, ſuſpected, hated, lamented fair one, he
ftabs himſelf to the heart, and exhibits a ſtriking
proof how terrible a creature a puny mortal is, when
agitated by an infernal paſſion.

intelligible; hams weak, knees to tering, head para-
lytic, hollow coughing, frequent expectoration,
breathleſs wheezing, laborious groaning, the body
ftooping under the inſupportable load of years, which
foon will cruſh it into the duft from whence it had
its origin.
FOLLY, that is, of a natural idiot, gives the face
an habitual thoughtleſs, brainleſs grin; the eyes
dance from object to object, withòut fixing ſteadily
upon any one; a thouſand different and incoherent
paffions, looks, geſtures, ſpeeches, and abſurdities,
are played off every moment.
DISTRACTION opens the eyes to a frightful
wideneſs; rolls them haſtily and widely from object
to object; diſtorts every feature; gnaſhes with the
teeth; agitates all the parts of the body; rolls in
the duſt; foams at the mouth ; utters, with hideous
bellowings, execrations, blafphemies, and all that
is fierce and outrageous; ruſhes furiouſly on all who
approach; and, if not reſtrained, tears its own fleſh,
and deſtroys itſelf.
Sickness has infirmity and feebleneſs in every
motion and utterance; the eyes dim and almoſt
cloſed; cheeks pale and hollow; the jaw fallen;
the head hung down, as if too heavy to be ſupported
by the neck; a general inertia prevails ; the voice
trembling; the utterance through the noſe; every
ſentence accompanied with a groan; the hand ſhaking,
and the knees tottering under the body, or the body
ſtretched helpleſs on the bed.
FAINTING produces a ſudden relaxation of all
that holds the human frame together, every ſinew
and ligament unſtrung; the colour flies from the
vermilion cheek; the ſparkling eye grows dim; down
the body drops, as helpleſs, and as ſenſeleſs as a
maſs of clay, to which, by its colour and appear.ince,
it ſeems haſtening to reſolve itſelf. Which leads me
to conclude with

ends in Death ; a ſubject almoſt too ſerious to be
made a matter of artificial imitation.
Lower degrees of every paſſion are to be expreſſed
by more moderate exertions of voice and geiture, as
every public Speaker's diſcretion will ſuggeſt to him.
Mixed paſſions, or emotions of the mind, require
a mixed Expreſſion. Pity, for example, is com-
poſed of Grief and Love : it is therefore evident
that a correct Speaker muſt, by his looks and geſtures,
and by the tone and pitch of his voice, expreſs both
Grief and Love in expreſſing Pity; and fo of the
reſt.
There may be other humours or paſſions beſides
theſe, which a Reader or Speaker may have occaſion
to expreſs, but theſe are the principal. And though
it may be alledged that ſome of theſe paſſions or
humours are ſuch as hardly ever come in the way
of the Speaker at the bur, in the pulpit, or either
houſe of parliament, it does not therefore follow
that the labour of ſtudying and practiſing the proper
ways of expreſſing thein is uſeleſs ; on the contrary,
every Speaker will find his account in enlarging his
ſphere of practice. A gentleman may not have
occaſion every day to dance a minuet ; but he has
occaſion to go into company every day, and he will
go into a room with much the better grace for his
having learned to dance in the moſt elegant manner.
The Orator may not have actual occaſion to expreſs
Anger, Jealouſy, Milice, and ſome few others of
the more violent paſſions, for which I have here
given rules; but he will, by applying his organs of
Elocution to expreſs them, acquire a matterly eaſe
and fluency in expreſſing thoſe he has actual occaſion
to expreſs.
It is to be remembered that the action, in ex-
preſſing the various humours and paſſions for which
I have here given rules, is to be ſuited to the age,
ſex, condition, and circumſtances of the character.
Violent Anger, or Rage, for example, is to be ex-
preſſed with great agitation (See AnGER); but the
raje of an infirin old man, of a woman, and of a
youth,

youth, are all different from one another, and from
that of a man in the flower of his age, as every
Speaker's diſcretion will ſuggeſt. A hero may ſhew
fear or ſenſibility of pain; but not in the fame
manner as a girl would expreſs thoſe ſenfations.
Grief may be expreſſed by a perſon reading a me-
lancholy ſtory, or deſcription, in a room; it may be
acted
upon the ſtage ; it may be dwelt upon by the
pleader at the bar; or it may have a place in a ſer-
mon. The paffion is ſtill grief; but, if they have
judgment, the manner of expreſſing it will be dif,
ferent in each of theſe Speakers.
A correct Speaker does not make a movement of
limb or feature for which he has not a reaſon. If
he addreſſes Heaven, he looks upward; if he ſpeaks
to his fellow-creatures, he looks round upon them ;
the ſpirit of what he ſays, or is faid to him, appears
in his look. If he expreſſes amazement, or would
excite it, he lifts up his hands and eyes; if he in-
vites to yirtue and happineſs, he ſpreads his arms,
and his looks are all benevolence; if he threatens
the vengeance of Heaven againſt vice, he bends his
eyebrow into wrath, and menaces with his arm and
countenance. He does not needleſsly ſaw the air
with his arm, nor ſtab himſelf with his finger. He
does not clap his right hand upon his breaft, unleſs
he has occafion to ſpeak of himſelf or to introduce
conſcience, or ſomewhat ſentimental. He does not
ſtart back, unleſs he wants to expreſs horror or aver-
fion. He does not come forward, but when he has
occafion to folicit. He does not raiſe his voice,
but to expreſs ſomewhat peculiarly emphatical. He
does not lower it, but to contraſt the railing of it. His
eyes, by turns, according to the humour of the
matter he has to expreſs, ſparkle fury, brighten into
joy, glance diſdain, melt into grief, frown diſguft
and hatred, languiſh into love, or glare diſtraction.
There is an error which is too inconfiderately re-
ceived by many judicious perſons, viz. that a public
Speaker's fhewing himſelf to be in earneſt, will alone
ſecure him of duly affecting his audience. Were
this

this true, the enthufuftie rant of the fanatic, who
is often very much in earneſt, ought to pleaſe the
judicious ; in whom, on the contrary, we know it
excites only laughter or pity. It is granted that Na-
ture is the rule by which we are to ſpeak, and to
judge of propriety in ſpeaking; and every public
Speaker, who faithfully follows that univerſal guide,
commands attention and approbation : but a Speaker
may, either through incurable natural deficiency,
or by deviating into fome incorrigible abſurdity of
manner, expreis the real and the warm ſentiments
of his heart in ſuch an awkward way, as ſhall effec-
tually defeat his whole defign upon thoſe who hear
him, and render himſelf the object of their ridicule.
It is not enough, as Quintilian ſays, to be a human
creature to make a good Speaker: as, on one hand, it
is not true that a Speaker's fhewing himſelf in earneſt
is alone fufficient; fo, on the other, it is certain that,
if he does not feem to be in earneſt, he cannot but
fail of his defign.
There is a true ſublime in Delivery, as in the
other imitative arts, in the manner as well as in the
matter of what an Orator delivers.
painting, ſculpture, muſic, and the other elegancies,
the true ſublime confiits in a ſet of maſterly, large,
and noble ftrokes of art, ſuperior to florid littleneſs,
ſo it is in Delivery. The accents are to be clear and
articulate, every ſyllable Itanding off from that
which is next to it, ſo that they might be numbered
as they proceed. The inflections of the voice are
to be ſo distinctly ſuited to the matter, that the hu-
mour or paſſion might be known by the ſound of the
voice only, where there could not be one word
heard ; and the variations are to be, like the full-
ſwelling folds of the drapery in a fine picture or Ita-
tue, bold, free, and forcible.
True Eloquence does not wait for cool approba-
tion; like irrefiftible beauty, it tranſports, it ravishes,
it commands the admiration of all who are within its
reach. If it allows us time to criticiſe, it is not
genuine; it ought to hurry us out of ourſelves, to

engage and ſwallow up our whole attention ; to drive
every thing out of our minds, befides the ſubject it
would hold forth, and the point it wants to carry.
The hearer finds himſelf as unable to reſiſt it, as to
blow out a conflagration with the breath of his
mouth, or to ſtop the ſtream of a river with his
hand; his paſſions are no longer his own; the Orator
has taken poffeffion of them, and, with fuperior
power, works them to whatever he pleaſes.
There is no earthly object capable of making ſuch
various and fuch-forcible impreſſions upon the human
mind as a conſummate Speaker. In viewing the
artificial creations, which flow from the pencil of a
Raphael, the critical eye is indeed delighted to a
high pitch, and the delight is rational, becauſe it
flows from ſources unknown to beings below the ra.
tional ſphere ; but the ear remains wholly unengaged
and unentertained.
In liſtening to the raptures of Corelli, Geminiani,
and Handel, the flood of pleaſure which pours upon
the ear is almoſt too much for human nature. And
mufic applied to expreſs the ſublimities of poetry,
as in the oratorio of Samſon, and the Allegro and
Penſoroſo, yields a pleafure fo truly rational, that a
Plato or a Socrates need not be aſhamed to declare
their fenfibility of it. But here again the eye has
not its gratification ; for the opera (in which action
is joined with muſic, in order to entertain the eye
at the ſame time with the ear) I muſt beg leave,
with all due ſubmiſſion to the taſte of the great, to
conſider as a forced conjunction of two things, which
nature does not allow to go together; for it never
will be other than unnatural to ſee heroes fighting,
commanding, threatening, lamenting, and making
love in the warblings of an Italian ſong.
It is only the elegant Speaker who can at once
regale the eye with the view of its moſt amiable ob.
ject, the human form in all its glory; the ear, with
the original of all mufic; the underſtanding, with
its proper natural food, the knowledge of inportant
truth; and the imaginatian, with all that, in nature

or in art, is beautiful, ſublime, or wonderful : for
the Orator's field is the univerſe, and his ſubjects
are all that is known of God and his works; of ſupe-
rior natures, good and evil, and their works ; and of
terreſtrials, and theirs.
In a conſuminate Speaker, whatever there is of
corporeal dignity or beauty, the majeſty of the hu-
man face divine, the grace of action, the piercing
glance, or gentle languiſh, or fiery flaſh of the eye;
whatever of lively patſion, or ſtriking emotion of
mind; whatever of fine inagination, of wife reflec-
tion, or irreſiſtible reaſoning; whatever of excellent
in human nature, all that the hand of the Creator
has impreſſed, of his own image, upon the noblett
creature we are acquainted with, all this appears in
the conſummate Speaker to the laigheſt advantage :
and whoever is proof againſt ſuch a diſplay of all
that is noble in human nature, muſt have neither
eye, nor ear, nor paſſion, nor imagination, nor taſte,
nor underſtanding.
Though it may be alledged that a great deal of
geſture or action, at the bar or in the pulpit, eſpe-
cially the latter, is not wanted, nor is quite in cha-
racter, it is yet certain that there is no part of the
man that has not its proper attitude. The
eyes are
not to be rolled along the ceiling, as if the Speaker
thought himſelf in duty bound to take care how the
Aies behave themſelves; nor are they to be con-
Itantly eaſt down upon the ground, as if he were
before his judge receiving fentence of death; nor to
be fixed upon one point, as if he ſaw a ghoſt. The
arms of the preacher are not to be needleſsly thrown
out as if he were drowning in the pulpit, or bran-
diſhed after the manner of the ancient pugiles, or
boxers, exerciſing themſelves by fighting with
their own ſhadow, to prepare them for the Olympic
conteſts ; nor, on the contrary, are his hands to be
pocketed up, nor his arms to hang by his fides, as
lank as if they were both withered. The head is
not to ſtand fixed, as if the Speaker had a perpetual
crick in his neck; nor is it to nod at every third
word,

word, as if he were acting Jupiter, or his would be
ſon Alexander.
A judicious Speaker is maſter of ſuch a variety
of decent and natural motion, and has ſuch com-
mand of attitude, that he will not be long enough
in one poſture to offend the eye of the ſpectator.
The matter he has to pronounce will ſuggeſt the
propriety of changing, from time to time, his look,
his poſture, his motion, and tone of voice, which,
if they were to continue too long the fame, would
become tedious and irkſome to the beholders ; yet he
is not to be every moment changing poſture like a
harlequin, nor throwing his hands about as if he
were ſhewing legerdemain tricks.
Above all things, the public Speaker is never tó
forget the great rule, Ars eſt celare Artem. It would be
infinitely more pleafing to ſee a public Speaker de-
liver himſelf with as little motion, and no better
attitude, than thoſe of an Egyptian mummy, than
that he diſtort himſelf into all the violations of deco.
rum which affectation produces. Art, feen through,
is execrable.
Modeſty ought ever to be conſpicuous in the be.
haviour of all who are obliged to exhibit themſelves
before the eye of the public. Whatever of geſture
or exertion of voice ſuch perſons uſe, they ought
to appear plainly to be drawn into them by the iin-
portance, ſpirit, or humour of the matter. If the Speaker
uſes any arts of Delivery which appear plainly to be
studied, the effect will be, that his awkward attempt to
work upon the paſſions of his hearers, by means of which
he is not maſter, will render him odious and con-
temptible to them. With what ſtiff and pedantic
folemnity do fome public Speakers utter thoughts
ſo trifling as to be hardly worth uttering at all! and
what unnatural and unſuitable tones of voice and
geſticulations do others apply in delivering what,
by their manner of delivering, one would be apt
to queſtion not only whether it is their own compo-
fition, but whether they really underſtand it.

TENDING TO EXPLAIN AND ILLUSTRATE THE
BLAUTIES OF FINE WRITING, AND THE PRIN-

To
enter into the elegancies of Compoſition in
the writings of others, or to avail ourſelves of
them in our own, nature muſt have furniſhed us with
lively ſentiment and clear diſcernment, and theſe
muſt be improved and aided by an acquaintance with
the principles of true Rhetoric.
Now Rhetoric may be defin'd to be the Art of
Faculty of Speaking and Writing with elegance and
dignity, in order to inſtruct, perſuade, and pleiſc.
Grammar only teaches plainneſs and propriety :
Rhetoric lays thele for its foundation, and raiſes upon
them all the graces of Tropes and Figures. Ele-
gance conſiſts in the purity and clearnels of the lan-
guage. Purity requires choice and proper words; a
command of which may be gained by ſtudying the
beit authors, by converſing with refined company,
and by frequent and careful compoſition : to obtain
perſpicuity or clearneſs, a full knowledge of our fub-
ject, and frequent cloſe meditation upon it, are ne-
cellary. You muſt likewiſe avoid ambiguous words,

a dry brevity, a confuſed length of periods, and too
large a train of metaphors together. Dignity ariſes
from ſubliine thoughts, noble tropes, and moving fi-
gures. Tropes alter and affect fingle words: Figures
affect and enliven whole ſentences. A Trope is a
word removed from its firſt and natural ſignification,
and applied with advantage to another thing, which
it does not originally mean; but only ſtands for it,
as it has relation to, or connection with it: as in this
ſentence, God is my rock. Here the Trope lies in
the word rock; which, it is plain, in its primary and
proper ſenſe, ſignifies nothing leſs than the hope and
truít mankind have in that adorable Being : yet be.
cauſe a rock is firm and immoveable, and a building
founded on it will not fink, it excites in our minds
the notion of God's unfailing power, and the ſteady
ſupport which good men receive from their depen-
dence on him. The neceſſity and uſe of Tropes
will be made plain in a few words.
1. No language furniſhes us with a ſufficient num-
ber of proper and plain words fully to expreſs all our
thoughts. The mind of man is of an aſtoniſhing cas
pacity, and has a numberleſs ſtore of notions; there-
fore, being often diſtreſſed for want of allowed and
proper terms to utter her conceptions in, ſhe turns
things all ways; conſiders them in their different re-
lations; and views them in all their various aſpects
and appearances; that ſhe may be enabled to declare
her meaning in ſuitable terins, and communicate
herſelf intelligibly and forcibly to perſons fhe has
converſation with. When we know not a man's
name which we have occafion to ſpeak of, we de-
fcribe him by his features, profefſion, habit, place of
abode, acquaintance, and other circumſtances, till
by ſuch a deſcription he is as well known to the people
we ſpeak to, as if we had at first given him his pecu-
liar name and diſtinguiſhing title.

to repeat the ſame thing ſeveral times; therefore, to
prevent the offence which the repetition of it in the
ſame words might probably give, he carefully diver-
fifies his expreſſion, and judiciouſly intermixes plain
and figurative language: lo he carries on his reader
or hearer with ſuch continual pleaſure, that he is
inſenſible of the length of the diſcourſe, and when
it is concluded, only wihes it had been longer; as a
traveller, if he has a good road and fair weather, if
he be entertained as he paſſes along with variety of
landſcapes, and pleaſant proſpects of groves, meadows,
parks, and fine houſes, never confiders or regrets
the length of the way, but comes in freſh and cheer-
ful to his journey's end. Tropes increaſe the ſtores
of language by exchanging, or borrowing what it has
not: it is by the help of Tropes that nothing in nature
III. Tropes add wonderful ornament and emphaſis
to a diſcourſe, and often give the mind a brighter
and ſtronger idea of a thing than proper words. We
receive much of our knowledge into the mind by the
outward ſenſes; and compariſons drawn from things
ſenſible and pleaſant, come eaſy and agreeable to the
mind, as exempting it from that ſevere ſtudy and ap-
plication which is neceſſary for the diſcovery of thoſe

of our ſenſes. Such are the properties and ſublime
powers of human ſouls, the attributes and majeſty
of Almighty God, which are in themſelves the moſt
venerable truths of nature, and of the higheſt im-
portance to mankind.
A good and beautiful Trope
often gives us a clearer apprehenſion of theſe things,
than large diſcourſes that are obſcured and cumbered
by perplexing reaſoning and endleſs divifions. Vir-
gil, calling the two Scipios the thunder-boits of war,
repreſents the rapid ſpeed and victorious progreſs of

yet
of the fruitfulneſs of the crop and the cheerfulneſs of
the ſeaſon, thon a long and particular relation, in the
beſt choſen plain words, could have raiſed. Tropes
at firſt, in the rude times of the world, uſed for ne-
ceſfity, were foon found to be ornamental, and to
give ſtrength and gracefulneſs to the turn of men's
thoughts. As garments, firſt put on for the neceſſary
defence of the body againſt the ſeverities of the
weather, were quickly found to be ſerviceable to ſet
off the comely proportions, and add to the dignity of
the body itſelf.
IV. Mankind are mightily pleaſed with a happy
and beautiful 'Trope, becauſe it expreſſes the bold-
neſs and felicity of an Author's fancy, which is not
content with things near and vulgar only, but ſteps
out of the common way to fetch in ſomething noble,
new, and ſurpriſing. By an expreſſive and beautiful
Trope a freſh notion is ſtarted to entertain the mind,
and it is not taken off from the ſubject before it,
only ſees it placed in a better and ſtronger light. That
you may make uſe of Tropes feaſonably and with
advantage, there following directions may be carried
in mind :
14. Beſparing and cautious in the uſe of them, and
omit then when they are not either as plain as pro-
per words, or more expreſſive. Tropes are the
riches of a language, and therefore it will be an im-
putation upon a man to lav th them away without
diſcretion. Too thick a crowd of them encumber a
diſcourſe, and make it obſcure and heavy; and that
is juſt contrary to the nature and deſign of Tropes;
which is to illuſtrate dark truths, and relieve the la-
bouring thoughts.
2d. Care muſt be taken that Tropes hold a propor.
tion to the ideas intended to le raiſed by them: and
this
may be taken in two ſenſes : firſt, there ought to
be an eaſy and unforced relation betwixt the Trope
and the proper word it is put for, or the thing in.
tended to be expreſſed by it. When there is not this
ſuitableneſs and relation, the expreſfion at beft will
not only be harſh and unpleaſant, but often barba.

rous and ridiculous. Such was the ſaying of the Ro-
man expołed by Tully : – The coinmonwealth
was caſtrated by the death of Cato.” The con-
nection between the Trope and the proper word ought
to be ſo cloſe and evident, that the one cannot be
well mentioned without raiſing the idea of the other.
This connection is either natural or artificial. The
natural is avhen the things expreſſed by their proper
and metaphorical names naturally reſemble one ano-
ther. When it is ſaid a man has arms of braſs, that
expreſſion readily and naturally conveys to one's un-
derſtanding a notion of the extraordinary ſtrength and
firmneſs of that man's arms. The artificial con-
nection depends upon uſe and eſtabliſhed cuſtom.
The Turks are generally etteemed a barbarous and
cruel people; a rude and unrelenting perſon is by
cuſtom called a Turk; and the frequent uſe of it in
this ſenſe makes the idea of the word Turk raiſe in
the mind the idea of a rude and unrelenting man.
The other way of preſerving the proportion above-
mentioned is, that`a Trope do not expreſs more or
leſs than the thing requires : that things capable of
heightening and ornament be not debated and vilified
by low expreſſions ; nor ſmall matters over-magnified
by pom pous and ſwelling words. Euripides is cen-
ſured by Ariſtotle for calling rowing the exerciſe of
the empire of the oar: and ſo may Cato for calling
a hill covered with brakes and thickets, by the name
of a wart. But if a Trope ſeem to be a little harſh,
and yet is neceſſary and very fignificant, you may
mollify and finooth it by a good epithet; or in a few
words without formality, begging the reader or
hearer to pardon the expreſſion.
3d. A Trope ought to be obvious and intelligible,
and therefore muſt not be fetched from things too
remote, ſo as to require much reading and learning
to apprehend it. If a man, ſpeaking of a houſe of
debauchery, fays, It is a dangerous rock of youth, the
relation lies plain to an ordinary capacity: but if he
calls it the Syrtes of youth, it is far fetched, and ob-
ſcure, becauſe fevy know that the Syrtes are fands on
the

the coaſts of Afric, which inevitably ſwallow up all
the ſhips that fall into them.
41h. No Tropes are to be uſed which convey a ſor-
did or lewd idea to the mind. Vile and debauched
expreſſions are the ſure marks of an abject and
gro-
velling mind. He who fo far forgets the deſign and
dignity of ſpeech, as to endeavour to poiſon and de-
bauch by it, inſtead of inſtructing in virtue, and
pleaſing men in order to do them good, acts againſt
reaſon and all the decencies and modeſty of human
nature.
To conclude, Tropes and metaphorical expreſſions
are either for neceffity, emphaſis, or decency.
For neceſſity, when we have not proper words to
declare our thoughts; for emphaſis, when the pro-
per words we have are not ſo comprehenſive and tig-
nificant; for decency, when plain language would
give offence and diſtalte to the reader.
1. M a
CH A P. II.
Containing a particular Account of the chief Tropes
of Language.
I. TETAPHOR is a by which we put a
ſtrange word for a proper word, by reaſon
of its reſemblance and relation to it. All Tropes are,
in ſtrict ſpeaking, Metaphors or tranſlations; yet
this is more peculiarly called ſo, by reaſon of its con-
ſtant uſe and peculiar beauty. But more plainly to
diſtinguiſh this particular Trope from the general
naine, it may be thus defined: A Metaphor is a
fimile or compariſon intended to enforce and illuſtrate
the thing we ſpeak of, without the ſigns or forms of
compariſon. Thus if we fay, God is a ſhield to good
men, it is a Metaphor, becauſe the ſign of the com-
pariſon is not expreſſed, though the reſemblance,
which is the foundation of the Trope, is plain : as a
ſhield guards him that bears it againſt the attacks and
ſtrokes of an enemy; ſo the providence and favour of
God protects good men from malice and misfortune,
But if the ſentence be put thus, God is as a ſhield to
good

71
good men-then it becomes a fimile or compariſon.
So, in ſhort, a Metaphor is a stricter or cloſer com-
pariſon, and a compariſon a looſer and leſs compact
Metaphor. The Metaphor is very vi yorous and beau-
tiful in that noble paffage of Lord Rofcommon, in his
Eſſay on Tranilated Verſe:
For who did ever in French authors ſee
The comprehenfive Engliſh energy?
The weighty bullion of one ſterling line,
Drawn in French wire, would thro’ whole pages
ſhine.
This Trope may be taken from any thing which is
the object of any of our ſenſes; but that is generally
the moſt agreeable and ſprightly which ariſes from
the ſenſe of ſeeing : becauſe, of all the ſenſes, ſeeing
is the moſt perfect and comprehenſive; the moſt un-
wearied and inquiſitive; the moſt deſirable and de-
lightful. That is a fine paffage of Archbiſhop Til-
lotſon, " Piety and virtue, in perſons of eminent
“ place and dignity, are feited to great advantage,
6" To as to caſt a luitre upon their very place, and,
“ by a ſtrong reflection, double the beams of Ma-
“ jeſty." This lively way of Expreſſion is of extra-
ordinary uſe in deſcriptions of conſiderable length;
it keeps the mind pleafed, and the attention awake.
If therefore an author is obliged to give a large ac-
count of things plain and of common obſervation, he
mult raiſe and ennoble them by ſtrong and graceful
Metaphors.
This rule Tully has obſerved, in his deſcription of
the ſeveral parts of this habitable world, in his books
concerning the nature of the gods : ſo has Virgil in
his Georgics, where he has made his meaneſt and
coarfeſt ſubjects fine and admirable by his judicious
uſe of Metaphors. The little affairs of ſhepherds
and farmers in his perfect lines appear with dignity.
His deſcriptions make the country a paradiſe, and •
his touch, as a noble wit (Boileau) exprelles it, turns
every thing into gold. Theſe are admirable and
very

very beautiful Metaphors, when the properties of ra-
tional creatures are applied to the animals, and thoſe
of animals to plants and trees: this way of treating
a ſubject gives life and beauty to the whole creation,
We receive the ſtrongeſt pleaſure from thoſe bold
and comprehenſive Metaphors, which, beſides the
illuſtration of the ſubject they are intended to raiſe
and improve, convey to us a freſh and lively image.
Thus Agamemnon (after all his dangers, mur-
dered by the hands of villains in his own kingdom)
is not ſaid barely to die, but to end
the fad evening of a ſtormy life.
I know no caſe in which Metaphors of a bold
found are more proper than in arrogant ſpeeches,
when men defy the gods, or quarrel with the dil-
penſations of Providence. Philætius, in the Odyſſey,
is no arrogant character; yet in one place (upon
conſidering the afflictions of his prince, whoſe piety
and virtue he was ſo well aſſured of) he falls into a
rant againſt Providence; in which the language is
as lively and vigorous, as the ſentiment is ill ground-
ed and abſurd :
O Jove! for ever deaf to human cries;
The tyrant, not the father, of the ſkies !
Unpiteous of the race thy will began :
The fool of fate, thy manufacture, man,
With penury, contempt, repulſe, and care,
The galling load of life is doom'd to bear.
II. Allegory is a continuation of ſeveral Meta-
phors all through the ſame ſentence or diſcourſe,
when one thing is faid, and ſomething different is
underſtood, as in the following paftage from Prior's
Henry and Emma.
Did I but purpoſe to embark with thee
On the ſmooth ſurface of a ſummer's ſea,
While


## p. 73 (#93) ##############################################

A HELP TO ELOCUTION. 73
While gentle zephyrs play with proſp'rous gales,
And fortune's favour fills the ſwelling fails ;
But would forſake the ſhip and make the ſhore,
When the winds whiſtle and the tempeſts roar ?
The uſe of an Allegory is to convey our ineaning
under diſguiſed terms, when to ſpeak it out in plain
may not be ſo fafe, ſo ſeaſonable, or effectual upon
the perſon we deſign to inſtruct by it. It is often
likewiſe uſed for magnificence and loftineſs; to raiſe
wonder, and gratify curioſity.
To prevent confufion, and want of decorum and
propriety in a diſcourſe, an Allegory muſt end as it
begun; and the fame Metaphor, which was choſen
at firſt, be continued to the laſt. Several Allegories
may be brought into one diſcourſe, at a ſmall diitance
one from another ; but every particular muſt be in a
ſentence diſtinct from the reſt, and muſt admit no-
thing foreign. 'To this may be referred Apologue
or Fable, which is afcribing the actions, paſſions,
and diſcourſe of mankind to the irrational and even
inanimate creation, with a deſign to inſtruct and af-
fect people with a uſeful moral dexterouſly conveyed.
III. Metonymy is a Trope whereby one name is
put for another, which it may properly ſtand for, by
reaſon of the near relation or mutual dependence there
is between both, as in Milton's Paradiſe Loſt:
-as Jupiter
On Juno'ſmiles, when he impregns the clouds,
That Thed May-flowers
By this Trope any of the moſt ſignificant circum-
ſtances or appendages of a thing are put for the ſub-
ject or chief thing to which they belong, or on which
they depend. But I think this Trope is uſed with
inuch more vigour and advantage in the following
caſes :
ift. When the narration or counſel ſtands for the
action, and what the poet or hiſtorian deſcribes he is
E
ſaid

74

faid to do; which is a vehement way of expreſſion,
exceeding the common as much as action goes be-
vond deſcription, and life excels painting, as in Dry-
den's Juvenal :
Againſt bold Turnus the great Trojan arm,
Amidſt their ſtrokes the poet gets no harm;
Achilles may in epic verſe be llain, &c.
2d. When the name of any relation is put for the
duty which that relation requires, and the benevo-
lence and tenderneſs which may be expected from it.
Anacreon, ſpeaking of money, ſays, " That through
" it there's no longer any ſuch thing as brethren or pa-
66 rents in the world. When the love of riches is the
reigning paſſion in a man, it baniſhes humanity; con-
“ founds right and diſtinction; and tramples upon the
“ moit ſacred and endearing relations in nature.
3d. Rivers, which contribute ſo much to the plenty
and pleaſantneſs of a country, are often mentioned
by the poets to expreſs the whole country in which
they ariſe, or through which they take their courſe *.
A branch of the Metonymy is Antonomaſia, or ex-
change of name, which put a fignificant and em-
phatical epithet, title, or character, for the proper
and moſt diſtinguiſhing name. The word which is
uſed for the principal and most proper name, is either
taken from the perſon's country, family, relation,
profeſſion, perſonal circumſtances, reſemblance to
ſome other perſon, or from the virtue or vice for
which he is remarkable. Sardanapalus was a monſter
of debauchery, Nero of cruelty; therefore to call
a very débauched perſon Sardanapalus, and a cruel
one Nero, brands them much deeper than to call
one debauched and the other cruel.
IV. Synecdoche, or comprehenfion, is a Trope
which
puts
the name of the whole for a part, or of
a part for the whole; a general for a particular of
the ſame kind, or a particular for a general. By this
Trope a round and certain number is often fet down
for
* See Theoc. Idyl. iv. 6.

75
for an uncertain one. The plural uſed for the fin-
gular generally gives an elevation and turn of gran-
deur to the diſcourle, as in the following paſſage from
- Virgil :
Leave earth, my mufe, and foar a glorious height,
Tell me what heroes flew the gallant Hector,
Cycnus, and Memnon terrible in arins.
When it is plain the poet only ſpeaks of Achilles; but
he uſes the plural number, to magnify the ſtrength
and courage of his hero; and to thew that one ſuch
brave man is of more value and importance in war,
than troops of common warriors. The treacherous
Sinon emphatically uſes the plural for the fingular,
when he would aggravate his danger of being ſacri-
ficed by his countrymen, and raiſe the horror of
their preparations for thoſe inhuman rites, as in the
following line from the above-mentioned author;
Ye curſed ſwords and altars which I 'fcap'd !
?
Sometimes a fingle collective word expreſſes multi-
tudes with more clearnels and vehemence than plural
would do; as in that paſſage of Herodotus, when
Phryınichus repreſented the deſtruction of Miletus
on the ſtage, the Theatre burſt out into tears. If the
author had ſaid all the people in the theatre burſt
out into tears, who ſees not that the expreſſion
would have been comparatively looſe and languid ?
But whether plurals be uſed for fingulars, or, on
the contrary, there is need of judgment and great
confideration to diſcern, that the way of ſpeaking
preferred to the other be, in that place and upon
that occaſion, more proper and beautiful: that it
more ſtrongly deſcribe the p.ffion, more agreeably
diverſify and adorn the period, and more effectually
contribute to the ſurpriſe and pleaſure of the reader.
V. Hyperbole is a Trope that goes beyond the
bounds of ſtrict truth, in repreſenting things greater
E 2

26 A HELP TO ELOCUTION..
or ſmaller, better or worſe, than really they are, in
order to raiſe admiration or love, fear or contempt,
as in the following lines from Dryden's Virgil :
-Camilla
Outſtript the wind in ſpeed upon the plain,
Flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain::
She ſwept the ſeas, and, as the ſkimm’d along,
Her flying foot unbath'd in billows hung.
Human nature is feldom content with things as
they are, but is apt to magnify what it admires to
the height of wonder, and fink what it defpifes or
hates to the loweſt degree of contempt. Things
great, new, and adınirable, extremely pleaſe the
mind of man ; but trifles, dreft up in gaudy orna-
ments and a counterfeit ſublime, give the utmoſt
averſion to a man of clear reaſon and elegant taſte:
therefore temper and judgment are to be uſed in
both branches of this Trope, in exceſs and defect;
that we neither fly too high nor ſink too low, that
'we neither miſapply nor carry too far our wonder,
nor our contempt: for to admire worthleſs things
and defpife excellences, is a fure fign of weakneſs
and ſtupidity; and, in the latter cafe, of ill-nature
and malice beſides. There are various ways of ex-
preſſing an Hyperbole ; I ſhall name three, which
Teem to be the chief.
ift. In plain and direct terms, which far exceed the
ftriétneſs of truth, as in the following line of Virgil:
The giant's lofty head o'ertops the clouds,
2d. By Similitude, or Compariſon, as in the follow-
ing froin Dryden's Virgil:
It ſeems as if the Cyclades again
Were rooted up and juſtled in the main :
Or floating mountains floating mountains meet :
Such is the firſt encounter of the fleet.
3d. By

zd. By a ſtrong Metaphor: as the poet, in the
place above-mentioned, inſtead of ſaying that Ca-
milla ran very ſwiftly, heightens the expreſſion, and
makes her fly. Two or three of theſe Tropes added
together raiſe our wonder and pleafure by carrying
up the diſcourſe to the utmoſt point of ſublimity.
Pindar; ſpeaking of Hercules invading the inhabi-
tants of Cos, ſays, that hero's attack upon them
was not like winds, or ſeas, or fire, but like a thun-
der-bolt; as if the fury of thoie was leſs, of this
only equal. There are the fame ſteps and degrees
of linking what is to be rendered contemptible and
ridiculous, as of raiſing what ſhould appear great-
and wonderful. It is a bold Trope, and muſt be
uſed with caution and judgment. In comical cha-
racters and pieces of humour and drollery, more
liberty is allowed than in ſerious and grave ſubjects.
Not only Plautus in the character of Euclio, in Aus
lularia ; but Horace, in the deſcription of his miſer,
carries it to a degree of extravagance.
VI. Irony is a Trope whereby a man ſpeaks con-
trary to his thoughts, that he may ſpeak with more
force and advantage. As when a notorious villain is
ſcornfully complimented with the titles of a very
honeſt and excellent perſon : the character of the
perfon ironically commended, the air of contempt
that
appears in the ſpeaker or writer, and the exor-
birance of the commendations, fufficiently diſcover
the diffimulation. Milton repreſents God Almighty
addreſſing his bleſſed Son upon the revolt of Lucifer,
and laughing to ſcorn the attempts of thoſe moſt
ungrateful and infatuated rebels in a very majeſtic
Irony:
Son! Thou in whom my glory I behold
In full reſplendence, heir of all my might,
Nearly it now concerns us to be ſure
Of our omnipotence!
E 3
And

And Dryden finely ridicules the Egyptian worſhip,
in a laughing ironical commendation of their leek
and onion gods :
Th' Egyptian rites the Jebuſites embrac'd ;
Where gods were recommended by their taite,
Such ſavory deities muſt needs be good,
As ſerv'd at once for worſhip, and for food.
Abfalom and Achitophel.
This way of expreſſion has great force in correct-
ing vice and hypocriſy, and daſhing vanity and im-
pudence out of countenance. To dreſs up a ſcanda-
lous wretch in all the virtues and amiable qualities
that are directly contrary to the vicious diſpoſitions
that have rendered him infamous, only makes him
ridiculous in theſe mock-ornaments, and more effectu-
ally expoſes him for a public mark of derifion. A
lively and agreeable kind of this Trope is ironical
exhortations ; by this, when a man has largely rec-
koned up the inconveniences and miſchiefs that at-
tend any practice or way of living, he concludes
with feigned encouragement and advice to act after
that manner, and purfue that very courſe of life.
So when Horace has beautifully deſcribed the tu-
mults, noiſe, and dangers of Rome, he cloſes his
deſcription with this drolling application :
Go
now,
and ſtudy tuneful verſe at Rome!
When a dying or dead perſon is inſulted with ſcoffs
and ironical tartneſs, it is uſually called a Sarcaſm,
which proceeds from heat of blood, eagerneſs of re-
fentment, and that arrogance and pride which pof-
feſſes the heart of man upon victory and ſucceſs.
Thus Pyrrhus, the ſon of Achilles, when Priam re-
proached him with cruelty, and put him in mind of
his father's contrary behaviour, inſults him with the
following farcaſın :
Thou


## p. 79 (#99) ##############################################

A HELP TO ELOCUTION.
79
Thou then be firſt, replies the chief, to go
With theſe fad tidings to his ghoſt below:
Begone,--acquaint him with my crimes in Troy,
And tell my fire of his degenerate boy. Piti's Virg.
Cuſtom has prevailed that any keen ſaying, which has
the true point of ſatire, and cuts deep, is called a
Sarcaſm.
VII. Catachreſis, or Abuſe, is a bold Trope,
which borrows the name of one thing to expreſsan-
other, which either has no proper name of its own,
or, if it has, the borrowed namie is more ſurpriſing
and acceptable by its boldneſs and novelty. Milton's
deſcription of Raphael's deſcent from the empireal
heaven to paradiſe, affords us a beautiful example of
this Trope :
in flight
Down thithér
prone
He ſpeeds, and thro' the vaſt etherial ſky
Sails between worlds and worlds-
The firſt way of uſing this Trope may be illuſtrated
by this inſtance: a parricide is ſtrictly and properly a
murderer of his father; but there is no appropriate
and authoriſed name in Engliſh for a murderer of his
mother, brother, fiſter, &c. therefore we call all
thoſe bloody unnatural wretches by the name of par.
ricides : and though at firſt there be a ſeeming im-
propriety in the word ſo applied, yet, upon a little
conſideration, we find that the ſenſe runs clear, and
the connection is juſt and obvious. It is no treſpaſs
againſt reaſon and propriety of language to give the
fame odious name to moniters, who are involved in
the ſame enormous guilt.
By this ſhort account, it is plain that there is a ge-
neral analogy or relation between all Tropes, and
that in all of them a man uſes a foreign or ſtrange
word inſtead of a proper one, and therefore ſays one
thing, and means fomething different. When he
ſays one thing, and means another almoſt the ſame,

it is a Synecdoche, or Comprehenfion : when he fays
one thing, and means another mutually depending,
it is a Metonymy: when he ſays one thing, and
means another oppoſite or contrary, it is an Irony:
when he ſays one thing, and means another like to
it, it is a Metaphor: a Metaphor continued, and often
repeated, becomes an Allegory: a Metaphor carried
to a great degree of boldneſs, is an Hyperbole; and
when at firſt found it ſeems a little harſh and ſhocking,
and may be imagined to carry fome impropriety in it,
it is a Catachrelis.

Giving an Account of the Nature, Neceffity, and
Ule of Figures in general.
1. FIGURE is a manner of ſpeaking different
from the ordinary and plain way, and more em-
phatical; expreſhing a paffion, or containing a beauty.
The beſt and moſt lively Figures do both. The
impreſſions of wonder, love, hatred, fear, hope, &c.
made upon the ſoul of man, are characteriſed and
communicated by Figures, which are the language of
the paſſions.
The ſoul hath ſuch a mighty command over that
curious organ the human body, that it can make all
the impreſſions upon it (while it is in health and har.
mony) whereby all the different affections and paſſions
are expreſſed. It can by its ſovereign pleaſure ſo
move and alter the blood and ſpirits, fo contract or
relax the nerves, that, in ſorrow, a deadneſs and
heavineſs ſhall make the countenance four : in anger,
a brutal fierceneſs ſhall inflame the eyes, and ruffle
the looks into deformity: in joy and cheerfulneſs, a
ſprightly gaiety ſhall finile in the eye, and enliven
every feature. The foul likewiſe tunes the organs of
ſpeech, and ſets them to that key which will molt
effectually expreſs her preſent ſentiments. So that
in joy, the voice ſhall be tender, flowing, and rap-
turous; in anger, fhrill, eager, and full of breaks:
in fear, low, confuſed, and Itammering.
II. The

II. The neceſſity of Figures may appear from the
following reaſons :
ift. Without Figures you cannot deſcribe a man in a
paſſion; becauſe man in a cool and fedate temper
is quite another thing from himſelf under a commo-
tion and vehement diſturbance. His eyes, his mo-
tions and expreffions are entirely different; and why
ſhould not the deſcription of him in ſuch" contrary
poſtures be fo? Nay, the ſeveral paſſions muſt be
as carefully diſtinguiſhed, as a ſtate of indolence and
tranquillity from any one paſſion. For inſtance, the
fame Hector taking leave of his lady and only ſon,
and afterwards purſuing the Greeks with fire and
ſword to their ſhips, muſt be painted with very dif-
ferent colours. There, he muft lay afide all the
fierceneſs and terror of the warrior, and appear with
all the condeſcenſion and goodneſs of a tender hufa
band and indulgent father. Here, he muſt reſume all
his military ardour ; a noble rage muſt ſparkle in his
face, and his very ſmiles muſt be terrible.
2d. If writers and ſpeakers deſire to affect their
readers and hearers, they muſt not only appear to be :
concerned, but muſt really be ſo.
When a man is vehemently moved with the paſſion
which he would inſpire other people with, he ſpeaks
with ſpirit and energy ; and will naturally break out
into ſtrong Figures, and all the ſuitable and moving
expreffions of an undifſembled eloquence. Unlearn
ed people, in grief, anger, joy, &c. utter their
paſſion with more vehemence and fluency than the
moſt learned, who are not heartily intereſted in the
matter, nor thoroughly warmed with the paſſion which
they deſcribe.. What the ſpeaker is, for the most
part the audience will be: if he be zealouſly con
cerned, they will be attentive: if he be indifferent,
they will be perfectly careleſs and cold. Fire kindles
fire ; life and heat, in the ſpeaker, enliven and in-
fpirit the hearer. As we ſee, by common experience,
that one very gay., and pleaſant perſon propagates
his cheerful humour wherever he comes, and gives
vivacity to a whole company; ſo, on the contrary, a

ſour and fullen wretch damps the livelineſs of all
about him, and infects them with his own melancholy
and gloomy temper.
3d. Figures are highly ſerviceable to clear difficult
truths; to make a ſtyle pleaſant and pathetical ; and
to awaken and fix attention.
III. I ſhall now only mention ſome of the direc-
tions which are given by our great maſters for the
prudent and proper uſe of Figures.
ift. Let your diſcourſe always be founded upon
nature and ſenſe, ſupported with ſtrong reaſon and
proof; and then add the ornaments and heightening
of Figures. A man of clear underſtanding will de-
ſpite the flouriſh of Figures, without fenfe; and
pomp of words, that wants truth and ſubſtance of
things. The regular way is to inform the judgment,
and then to raiſe the paſſions. When your hearer is
ſatisfied with your argument, he is then at leiſure to
indulge his paſſions; and your eloquence and pathe-
tical addreſs will ſcarce fail to have power and preva-
lence over him.
2d. Be ſparing in the uſe of Figures. A paſſion
deſcribed in a multitude of words, and carried on to
a diſproportionate length, fails of the end propoſed,
and tires inſtead of pleafing. Contract your force
into a moderate compaſs, and be nervous rather than
copious : but if at any time there be occafion for you
to indulge a copiouſneſs of ſtyle, beware it does not
run into looſeneſs and luxuriance.
3d. Figures muſt not be over-adorned, nor affect-
edly laboured, and ranged into nice and fcrupulous
periods. By affectation and ſhew of art, the orator
betrays and expoſes himſelf; and it is apparent, that
he is rather ambitious to ſet off his parts and wit,
than to expreſs his fincere concern and paſſion. His
hearer will deſpiſe him as a trifler, and hate his hy-
pocrify., who attempts to delude him with falſe rea-
ſoning; and perſuade him to the belief of what he
himſelf does not believe. Therefore he will itand
upon his guard againſt a man, whom he fufpects to
have

have deſigns upon him; and who propoſes to triumph
over his weakneſs. Sprightlineſs of thought and
ſublimity of ſenſe moſt naturally produce vigorous
and tranſporting Figures; and moſt beautifully con-
ceal the art, which muſt be uſed in cloathing them in
ſuitable expreſſions. The thought is ſo bright, and
the turn of the period ſo eaſy, that the hearer is not
aware of their contrivance, and therefore is more
effectually influenced by their force.

Of the chief and moſt moving Figures of Speech.
I. XCLAMATION is a Figure that expreſſes
the breaking out and vehemence of any
paſſion :
O unexpected ſtroke, worſe than of death!
Muſt I thus leave thee, paradiſe! thus leave
Thee, native foil! theſe happy walks and ſhades,
Fit haunt of gods !
Milt. Par. Lolt.
Some Figures are the proper language of fome
particular pafſions; but this expreſſes them all. It
is the voice of nature when ſhe is in concern and
tranſport. The paſſion of Andromache, upon the
news of her ſon's being fentenced to be thrown fron
a precipice and daſhed in pieces, and that of Hecuba
upon the view of his mangled body, are as maſterly
touches as any in Euripides: on that occafion the tra-
gic muſe put on her robe of deepeſt mourning, and
deplored the untimely and cruel fate of the royal in-
nocent in the tendereſt and moſt melting ſtrains of
forrow.
II. Doubt expreſſes the debate of the mind with
itſelf upon a preſſing difficulty. A man in a fevere
ſtrain and perplexity firſt takes up one reſolution,
and then lays it aſide; after thinks another method
more convenient, and then changes again. He is
tofled to and fro with itrong tides of pallion; and at
last,

Jaſt, after terrible ſtruggles, fcarce fixes upon a final
determination. Thus Dido, after the departure of.
her lover :
What ſhall I do? what fuccour can I find ?
Become a ſuppliant to Hiarbas' pride ?
And take my turn to court and be deny’d..
Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go?.
Forſake an empire, and attend a foe?
Then ſhall I ſeek alone the churliſh crew;:
Or with my fleet their flying ſails purſue ?
Rather with ſteel thy guilty breaſt invade,
And take the fortune thou thyſelf haft made.
Dryd. Virg. Æn. vi
This Figure keeps us in eager attention, and moves:
all our tenderneſs and compaſſion for the unhappy
ſufferer.
III. Correction is a Figure, whereby a man earneſtly
retracts and recalls what he had ſaid or reſolved :
-Firſt and laſt
On me, me only, as the ſource and ſpring
Of all corruption, all the blaine lights due ::
So might the wrath ! fond with! couldſt thou ſup--
port
That burthen heavier than the earth to bear;
Than all the world nuch heavier ? Milt. Par. Loft.
When what an author hath ſaid appears too much,
he abates. by correcting himſelf, and uſing ſome lef-
fening expreſſion: “ What is it then can give men
6* the heart and courage,_but I recall that word,
" becauſe it is not true courage, but fool-hardineſs,
to outbrave the judginents of God*?" Whena
what has been ſaid appears too little, he ſtrengthens
the expreſſion, and enlarges the thought : “ This
66
was great trouble to me, but that much more,
66 that:

b6 that before my face they. thus entertained, careſſed,
6b and kiſſed any enemy: my enemy, did I ſay?:
Nay. the enemy of the laws, the courts of juſtice,
" of peace, his country, and all good men *;" An
author, thus correcting and checking himſelf, pre-
vents cavils and object ons; and, by the unexpected
quickneſs of the recollection and turn, pleaſingly
furpriſes the reader, and all, of. a. ſudden fires him
with his own paſſion..
IV. Suppreſſion is a Figure whereby a perſon in
rage, or other diſturbance in mind, ſpeaks not out
all he means, but ſuddenly breaks ofi his diſcourſe.
The gentleman in Terence, extremely incenſed
againſt his adverſary, only accoſts him with this
abrupt ſaying, Thow of all- -: the exceſs of his
indignation and rage choaked the paſſage of his voice,
and would not ſuffer him to utter the reſt : but in theſe
eaſes, though-the diſcourſe is not complete, the mean--
ing is readily underſtood ; and the evidence of the
thought eaſily ſupplies the defect of words.
Suppreffion ſometimes proceeds from modeſty, and
fear of uttering any word of ill and offenfive ſound.
V. Omiſſion is, when an author pretends that he
conceals and omits what he declares : " I do not
" inention my adverſary's fcandalous gluttony and
" drunkenneſs : I take no notice of his brutal luits :
" I ſay not a fyllable of his treachery, malice, and
* cruelty.” In eager paſſion and conteſts, variety
of arguments crowd into a man's thoughts; but he is.
fo moved and diſturbed that he cannot regularly en-
large upon them. Beſides, he has ſome fear, that
if he ſhould ſay all his indignation would dictate, he
might treſpaſs upon the patience of his hearer ; there-
fore he only gives ſhorter hints, and pretends that
time and reverence for them will not allow him to
be more copious and exprefs. This Figure is fer-
viceable
* Cicero,

viceable to an orator in propoſing his weaker argu-
ments; which yet he knows lie more level to the
capacities of ſome part of his audience, which he de-
fires to have an intereſt in. Therefore he does not
quite omit them, becauſe they may make impreſſions
on thoſe people to his advantage: and yet he men-
tions them with an air of modeíty and caution, left
he ſhould diſguſt another part of his audience, to
whom they do not appear of equal force and con-
viction.
VI. Addreſs or Apoſtrophe is, when in a vehe-
ment commotion a man turns himſelf on all ſides, and
applies to the living and dead, to angels and men, to
rocks, groves, and rivers :
O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!
With other echo late I taught your ſhades
To anſwer, and reſound far other ſong.
Milt. Par. Loft.
When the paſſion is violent, it muſt break out and
difcharge itſelf. By this Figure the perſon moved
delires to intereſt univerſal nature in his cauſe; and
appeals to all the creation for the juſtneſs of his tran-
ſport. Adam's morning hymn in Milton's Paradiſe
Loft, ver. 153, is a chain and continuation of the
moſt beautiful and charming Apoſtrophes.
When the .poets addreſs a muſe or fome divine
power to allift and direct them, this kind of Apoftro-
phe, or poetical prayer, is called Invocation, by
which they gain eſteem both to their perſons and
poems: they are looked upon as favoured, and their
poems as inſpired, by Heaven. In the progreſs of
their poems they often repeat theſe pious addreſſes ;
eſpecially when a difficulty ariſes, that ſurinounts
human power; or a ſecret is to be revealed that
could not be found out by human fagacity.
A fpecies of this Figure I take Communication to
be; when the ſpeaker applies to the judge and hearers,
and entreats there opinion upon the queſtion in de-
bate.


## p. 87 (#107) #############################################

A HELP TO ELOCUTION. 87
bate. By this a man declares his hearty and un-
feigned concern for the cauſe; and pays deference
and honour to thoſe he addreſſes. They are pleaſed
with his modeſty and fubmiffion, and ſo inclined to
hear and judge with favour. There is a fort of
Communication ſomething different from this, when
a perſon excuſes his conduct, gives reaſons for it,
and appeals to thoſe about him, whether they are
not ſatisfactory :
Let envious jealouſy, and canker'd ſpite,
Produce my actions to ſevereſt light,
And tax my open day or ſecret night.
Did e'er my tongue fpeak my unguarded heart
The leaſt inclin" to play the wanton's part ?
Did e'er my eye one inward thought reveal,
Which angels might not hear, and virgins tell?
· And halt thou in niy conduct, Henry, known
One fault but that which I muſt ever own,
That I, of all mankind, have lov'd but thee alone?
Prior.
VII. Suſpenſion begins and carries on a period or
diſcourſe in ſuch a manner as pleaſes the reader all
along; and keeps him in expectation of ſome confi-
derable thing in the conclufion. With what infinite
ſweetneſs does Eve carry on, with what grateful ſur-
priſe cloſe up, that rapturous ſpeech to Adam ?
Sweet is the breath of morn, her riſing ſweet,
With charm of earlieſt birds; pleaſant the ſun,
When firſt on this delightful land he ſpreass
His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,
Gliſtring with dew: fragrant the earth
After ſoft ſhowers; and ſweet the coming on
Of grateful evening mild; then, filent night
With this her folemn bird, aud this fair morn,
And theſe the gems of heaven, her ſtarry train.
But neither breath of morn when ſhe aſcends
With charm of earlieſt birds, nor riſing ſun
In this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, flower,
Glitring
1

Glift'ring with dew, nor fragrance after ſhowers,
Nor grateful evening mild, nor filent night
With this her ſolemn bird, nor walk by moon,
Nor glittering ſtarlight--without thee is ſweet
Milt. Par. Lofi.
This beautiful Figure makes people attentive; and
when it is perfect, as here, amply rewards the cloſeſt
attention. .Great care muſt be taken that the expec-
tation which is raiſed be not diſappointed : for no-
thing is more vain and contemptible than to promiſe
much and perform little; to uſer in an errant trifle
with the formality of preface and folemn preparation.
VIII. Interrogation is, when the writer or orator
raiſes queſtions and returns anſwers; not as if he was
in a ſpeech or continued diſcourſe, but in dialogue
or conference with his reader, auditor, or adverfary :
“. Tell me, will you go about and aſk one another,
" What news ? What can be more aſtoniſhing news
6 than this, that the man of Macedon makes war
upon the Athenians, and diſpoſes the affairs of
“ Greece? Is Philip dead?: No; but he's fick.
" What fignifies it to you whether he be dead or
“ alive! for if any thing happen to this Philip,
“ you will immediately raiſe up another *."
this delivered without interrogation had been faint
and ineffectual; but the ſuddenneſs and fervour of
queſtion and anſwer imitates the tranſport of paifion;
makes the diſcourſe to found with probability, and to
be heard with attention. What is ſaid after ſuch a
warm and eager manner does not ſeem the effect of
ſtudy and preineditation, but the natural reſult and
effuſion of a man's unfeigned concern. The orator
conceals his art and design, and ſo gains the eſteem
of the audience for his fincerity and heartineſs; they
lie open to him, and are carried along with the tor-
rent of his paffion and refiftleſs eloquence. Scarce
any paſſion can be named but may be put into the
form,
* Demoſthenes, quoted by Longinus,

form of Interrogation, and may appear with beauty
and advantage in it.
Expoftulation is nearly related to this vigorous and
preſſing Figure: whereby the injured perfon urges
the offender with all the proper queſtions he thinks
can be propoſed, and pleads with him froin all the
topics of reaſon ; that he may convince him of his
injuſtice, and make him athuned of his folly and in-
gratitude ; that he may beat him off his excufes and
pleas of abatement, that he may reduce him to an
ingenuous proinite and ſteady reſolution for the fu-
ture to obſerve his duty:
" For what have you left unattempted, what have
you eſteemed facred theſe late days? What name
" ſhall I beitow on this afiembly? Shall I call you
"" ſoldiers, who have beſieged your general and em-
" peror's ſon with trenches and arms? Citizens, who
"' lo contemptuouſly inſult the authority of the
* ſenate *?"
IX. Prevention is, when an author ſtarts an ob.
jection, which he forfees may be made againſt any
thing he affirms, defires, or adviſes to; and gives
an anſwer to it :
What then remains ? Are we depriv'd of will?
Mutt we not ask for fear of alking ill?
Receive my counſel, and ſecurely move ;
Intruſt thy fortune to the Pow'rs above.
Leave God to manage for thee, and to grant
What his unerring wiſdom ſees thee want.
Dryd. Juv.
This generally gets the author the reputation of
forelight and care ; of diligence and a generous aſſu.
rance of the reaſon and jultice of his cauſe. When

he puts the objections againſt himſelf in their full
force, it is plain that he does not fear the cleareſt
light, nor decline the ſtricteſt examination. By it
likewiſe ſome advantage is gained over an adverſary :
he is foreſtalled and prevented in his exceptions; and
either filenced, or obliged to a repetition ; which is
not ſo grateful as the mention of a thing freſh and
untouched.
To this Figure may be referred Premunition,
whereby the ſpeaker, eſpecially in the entrance and
beginning of his diſcourſe, cautiouſly guards himſelf
againit prejudice and miſapprehenfion : that he may
neither leſſen his interest with his friends, nor in-
flame the malice, and increaſe the power of thoſe
who watch to do him miſchief.
X. Conceffion freely allows fomething that yet
might bear diſpute, to obtain ſomething that a man
would have granted to him, and which he thinks
cannot fairly be denied.
This Figure is ſometimes favourable in the begin-
ning, but ſevere and cutting in the cloſe ; as Tully
upon the Greeks :" I allow the Greeks learning,
" and ſkill in many ſciences ; ſharpneſs of wit, and
“ fluency of tongue ; and if you praiſe them for
any other excellences, I fhall not much contra-
6 dict you : but that nation was never eininent for
66 tenderneſs of conſcience, and regard to faith and
“ truth.” Sometimes the firſt parts are fretting and
ſevere, but the concluſion healing :-" I am, Sir, I
own, a pimp, the common bane of youth, a per-
“ jured villain, a very peſt; but I never did you an
" injury *.” The ſhew of candour and veracity a
man makes by this Figure, in frankly granting fo
much, removes from him the ſuſpicion of partiality,
and gives him more credit and authority in what he
denies.
Another fort of Conceſſion is, when fearing we
cannot obtain all we deſire, we give up one part to
carry

carry the reſt. When Dido deſpairs of prevailing
with Æneas to ſettle with her at Carthage, the only
entreats he would ſtay a little longer, to allow her
ſome time to aſlwage her grief, and prepare to bear
his departure :
Tell my perfidious lover, I implore
The name of wedlock he diſclaims, no more :
No more his purpos'd voyage I detain
From beauteous Latium, and his deſtin'd reign.
For ſome finall interval of time I move,
Some ſhort, ſhort ſeaſon to ſubdue my love,
Till reconcil'd to this unhappy itate,
I grow at laſt fainiliar with my fate :
This favour if he grant, my death ſhall pleaſe
His cruel ſoul, and let us both at eafe.
Pitt's Virg. Æn. iv.
It is by this Figure that oppreſſed people in the
extremity of their indignation provoke their enemies
to do them all the miſchief they can, and proceed
ſtill to farther degrees of barb:rity ; that ſuch lively
repreſentations of their injuſtice and cruelty may
strike them with horror and ſhame, and diſpoſe them
to relent. The complaints and upbraidings of jarring
friends and lovers are moſt emphatically expreſſed in
this Figure; the deſign of which is to give the guilty
perſon a deep fenfe of his unkindneſs, and to kindle
all the old paſſion and tenderneſs:
}
Proceed, inhuman parent, in thy fcorn,
Root out my trees, with blights dellroy my corn;
My vineyards ruin, and my ſheepfolds burn:
Let looſe thy rage, let all thy ſpite be ſhown,
Since thus thy hate purſues the praiſes of thy fon.
Dryd. Virg. Geor. iv.

nuation, whereby the orator, after he has uſed all
his arguments to perfuade his hearers, as it were
once more ſets them at liberty, and leaves them to

their own election; it being the nature of man to
ſtick more ſtedfaſtly to what is not violently impoſed,
but is our own free and deliberate choice : 6. If it
“ ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chooſe you
" this day whom you will ſerve.”. When the great
Joſhua had, under God, in the moſt aſtoniſhing man.
ner, conquered the people of Canaan, and conducted
the Iſraelites into their land, he exhorts them to a
ſteady adherence to the worſhip of the true God,
who had fo viſibly appeared for them, and made
them ſo gloriouſly triumph over their enemies. In
the conclution of his ſpeech, well knowing the ad-
vantage and merits of his cauſe, and that he might
fafely appeal to their conſcience and experience for
the truth of what he ſaid, he leaves them to their own
liberty and choice. As if that brave man had ſaid,
My friends and country.men, if I ſhould enlarge on a
matter ſo plain, it might ſeem a diſtruſt upon
both
your underſtanding and ingenuity. I leave all to
you, not in the leaſt fufpecting that you can refift
ſuch arguments as cannot fail to work upon any one,
who has either reaſon or gratitude.
|
XI. Repetition is a Figure which gracefully and
emphatically repeats either the ſame word, or the
faine ſenſe in different words.. Care is to be taken
that we run not into infinite tautologies, nor affect a
trifling found and chime of infignificant words. All
Turns and Repetitions are fo that do not contribute
to the ſtrength and luſtre of the diſcourſe; or at leaſt
one of them. The nature and deſign of this Figure
is to make deep impreſſions on thoſe we addreſs. It
expreſſes anger and indignation ; full affurance of
what we affirm, and vehement concern for what we
have eſpouſed.
The moſt charming Repetitions are thoſe where-
by the principal words in a ſentence, either the ſame
in found or fignification, are repeated with ſuch ad-
vantage and improvement, as raiſes a new thought,
or gives a muſical cadence and harmony to the pe-
riod. Theſe in Engliſh are called fine Turns; and
are

93
are either
upon the words or the thought, or both.
A dexterous Turn upou words is pretty ; the Turn
upon the thought ſubſtantial; but the conſummation
and crown of all is, when both the found of the
words is grateful, and their meaning comprehenſive;
when beth the reaſon and ear are entertained with a
noble thought vigorouſly expreſſed, and beautifully
finiſhed. That in Mr. Prior’s Henry and Emma is
a very agreeable Turn:
Are there no poiſons, racks, and flames, and ſwords,
That Emma thus muſt die by Henry's words?
Yet what could fwords, or poiſons, racks, or flame,
But mangle and disjoint this brittle frame?
More fatal Henry's words; they murder Emma's
fame.
Prior,

i
Strong and vehement paffions will not admit Turns
"upon words ; nor ought they to have place in heroic
poems, or in grave exhortations and folemn diſcourſes
of morality. To this Figure, which has greater va-
riety and many branches, may be referred the uſing
many words of the fame fignification to expreſs one
important thing. When a man is full of his ſub-
ject, and eager to communicate his thoughts with
vigour, he is not ſatisfied with one expreffion, though
never ſo ſtrong ; but uſes all the ſignificant variety
he can recolleet. So Tully for Milo*. " The affai-
166 fin was baffled, force repelled by force, or rather
66 boldneſs overcome by bravery. If reaſon pre-
66 ſcribes this to the learned, and neceſſity to Barba-
" rians, cuſtom to nations, and nature itſelf to brute
66 beaits, always to beat off all manner of violence,
“ by all poſſible ways, from their body, from their .
.66 head, from their life; you cannot judge this to
56 be a criminal and wicked action, but at the ſame
66 time you muſt judge that all perſons, who fall
amongſt robbers and bravoes, muſt either periſh
weapons, or your
ſentence."

in the heat of his engagement, in the vehemence of
his indignation againſt an inſolent and unreaſonable
adverſary, and his earneſt concern for the preſerva-
tion of a dear friend in danger, exerts the utmoſt
power of his eloquence, redoubles his ſtrokes, and
eagerly puſhes on all his advantages.
XII. Periphraſis or Circumlocution ufes more and
ſometimes leſs plain words, to avoid ſome inconve-
nience and ill effect which would proceed from ex-
preſſing a thing in fewer and plainer words.
When Tully * could not deny the death of Clo-
dius, and was defending Milo charged with his mur-
der, he ſays, Milo's ſervants, without the command,
knowledge, or preſence of their maſter, did what
every maſter would expect his ſervants ſhould do in
the like caſe. He avoids the word killed or fiabbed,
for fear of offending the people. This method of
treating a ſubject gives the audience a good opinion
of the prudence and modeſty of the pleader: one
unguarded and diſtaſteful word has ſometimes loft
the ſpeaker the favour of the audience, before well
inclined to him, and ruined a promiſing cauſe.
Very often Circumlocution is uſed, not merely
out of prudence or neceſſity to conceal a ſecret, or
cover an indecency; but for variety and ornament,
to give pomp and dignity to our expreſſions, to en-
rich a diſcourſe with new thoughts, and to multiply
the graces of a defcription :
The night's bright empreſs in her golden car
Darting full glories from her lovely face,
Kindles fresh beauties in the eye of Heſper.
XIII. Amplification is, when every chief expref-
fron in a period adds ſtrength and advantage to what
went before; and ſo the ſenſe all along heightens, till
the period be vigorouſly and agreeably cloſed :

" It is pleaſant to be virtuous and good, becauſe
56 that is to excel many others : it is pleaſant to
grow better, becauſe that is to excel ourſelves :
nay, it is pleaſant even to mortify and fubdue our
" luſts, becauſe that is victory : it is pleaſant to
66 cominand our appetites and paſſions, and to keep
" them in due order, within the bounds of reaſon
" and religion, becauſe this is empire *.” When
an author thus improves upon us in his diſcourſe, we
are extremely pleaſed and attentive while he conti-
nues it; and perfectly fatisfied when he concludes.
We are edified and charmed with the inſtruction of
one whom we find to be complete matter of his
ſubject. What reputation muſt it be to the writer,
what pleaſure to the reader, when one ſays every
thing in the beſt manner it can be faid; and the other
is entertained with every thing that can be deſired!
but it is the utmoſt reproach to an author, and a moſt
intolerable diſappointment to the reader, when the
one fags and faulters every ſtep ; and ſo the other
is fatigued and mortified with a continual ſeries of
heavy and lifelels periods. There are various ways
of contriving and forming this Figure, which have
great force and elegance; though perhaps they can-
not nicely be adapted to every part of the definition.
I ſhall name three very lively ways of expreſling an
Amplification.
ijt. We amplify or raiſe a diſcourſe by ſelecting a
number of the moſt emphatical and ſtrongeſt words
of the language we ule; every one of which adds
ſomething new to the ſentence; and, all joined,
heighten it to the utmoſt degree of perfection. That
pafiage in Pope's Effay on Man is upon this account
adınired:
1
Who ſees with equal eye, as God of all,
A hero periſh, or a ſparrow fall,
Atoms or ſyſtems into ruin hurld,
And now a bubble burſt, and now a world.

2d. This Figure is ſometimes expreſſed by way of
compariſon or appoſition:“ When that great man
56 P. Scipio, though but a private perſon, killed Ti-
" berius Gracchus, making ſome ſmall innovation
c and disturbance in the ſtate ; ſhall we, who are
46 conſuls, bear Cataline, who is endeavouring and
plotting to lay the world waſte with fire and
u ſword*?.”
3d. A diſcourſe is very happily and beautifully
heightened by way of argument or rational inference.
Quintilian + excellently obſerves, that Homer gives
us a very exalted idea of Helen's fovereign charms,
when he introduces Priam's grave counſellors owning,
that it was not to be complained of or reſented, that
the Trojans and Greeks had ſuſtained the calamities
of a long and cruel war for ſuch a woman ; and
makes the king himſelf place her by him, call her,
dear child, and treat her with all poſſible tenderne's
and reſpect. Muſt not every judicious reader infer
that her beauty must be incomparable, which was
admired and praiſed to ſuch a degree by men cool
and unpaſſionate, of mature wiſdom and great age, who
had been deep ſufferers by it? muſt not that face be
ſuperlatively lovely, and thoſe eyes ſparkle with re-

the argument and period be brought to a noble con-
cluſion. This Figure, when, natural and vigorous,
furniſhes the mind with variety of ideas, and accuſ-
toms it to attention and cloſe thinking. The art
and contexture of a Gradation often appears plain,
and lies in too open view; therefore care muſt be
taken that the Gradations we uſe be inforced, and
abound with good fenfe; he fignificant and dexterously
turned. I am pleaſed with that in Dr. Tillotſon *:
“ After we have practiſed good actions a while,
they become eaſy; and when they are eaſy, we
“ begin to take pleaſure in them; and when they
“ pleaſe us, we do them frequently; and by fre-
quency of acts a thing grows into a habit; and a
" confirined habit is a ſecond kind of nature; and ſo
" far as any thing is natural, ſo far it is neceſſary,
46 and we can hardly do otherwiſe; nay, we do it
many
times when we do not think of it."
XIV. Omiffion of a copulative, is when the coni-
junctions, or little particles that connect words - to-
gether, are left out, to repreſent haſte, or eagerneſs
of paffion.
When Dido, in the violence of her rage and re-
ſentiment for the abrupt departure of Æneas, charges
-her people to arm themſelves and purſue the Trojan
fleet:
Haſte, haul my gallies out, purſue the foe,
Bring flaming brands, fet fail, impetuous row .
The menibers of the period are looſe and uncon-
nected; which moſt naturally paints the hurry and
diſtraction of her thoughts. The conjunctions put
between the words would have cramped and fettered
the period, ſo that it would have moved flow and
unwicidy, and have been far from a repreſentation
of the raging queen's diſturbance of mind, and vehc-
mence of pallion.

Salluft * excellently and very naturally repreſents
the rout and precipitate flight of the Moors in theſe
words : Tum ſpectaculum horribile in campis patentibus :
fequi, fugere, occidi, capi.
The contrary to the former-multitude of
copu-
latives is when the little particles are properly put in
before every principal word in the period.
Livy, giving an account how the pleaſures and
luxury of Capua corrupted and ſoftened the army of
Hannibal, among others has this beautiful paſſage:
- For ſleep, and wine, and feaſts, and ſtrumpets,
“ and bagnios, and reft, that through cuſtom grow
every day more bewitching, had to weakened both
" their bodies and their minds, that the reputation
“ of their paſt victories protected them more than
" their preſent ſtrength t." This Figure, when
aptly and judiciouſly uſed, makes a diſcourſe ſtrong
and folemn, fixes an emphaſis upon every word,
and points it out as worthy of obſervation.
XV. Oppoſition is a Figure whereby things very
different or contrary are compared and placed near,
that they may ſet off each other. White placed near
black ſhines brighter: innocence compared with guilt
appears with double charms and lovelineſs.
The poets, hiſtorians, and orators, improve their ſub-
ject, and much heighten the pleaſure of their reader,
by the beautiful oppoſition of the characters and de-
fcriptions.
Tacitus deſcribes the exceſſive dalliances and
frantic revels of the Empreſs Meſſalina with Silius,
a little before their death, in wonderful pomp
and
gaiety of expreſſion ; that the reader may be the
more ſurpriſed and aſtoniſhed at the ſuddenneſs and
terrible circumſtances of her fall. The poet || in his
fine deſcription of Dido's defpair, the night before her
death, repreſents all the creation enjoying profound

the
tranquillity and ſweet relt, to render that miferable
queen’s diſquietudes more moving. She was deprived
of the common privilege indulged to the pooreſt and
moſt deſpicable creatures ; fleep fled from her eyes,
and quiet was banifhed from her breaſt.
In Virgils ſecond Georgic there is a very agree-
able contraſt and oppoſition, in that fine compari-
fon between the court and country; pomp and
hurry of ſtate ; and the freedom and pure pleaſures
of retirement and agriculture. Upon a full ennu-
meration of the ſeveral conveniences and enjoyments
of both ways of living, what advantage and over-
balances does the poet give to the latter! the very
manner of his expreſſion, and turn of his poetry, are
with great judgment and dexterity varied, and made
ſuitable to his different ſubjects. The deſcription of
the pride and ſtatelineſs of the great is drawn to the
life in a pompous run of verſe, and variety of very
bold Tropes :
.
-Ingentem foribus domus aita ſuperbis,
Mane falutantûm totis vomit ædibus undam ;
-Varios inhiant pulchrâ teſtudine poſtes,
Illufafque auro veltes
Virg. Georg. ii.
But you have the innocence and plainneſs, the ſweet-
nels and undifturbed quiet of the country, naturally
- repreſented in proper words, in plain and eafy exprel-
kon, and in the ſmootheſt and ſweeteſt numbers:
At ſecura quies, & nefcia fallere vita,
Dives opum variarum ; at latis otia fundis,
Spelunce, vivique lacus ; at frigida Tempe,
Mugituſque boum, moleſque ſub arbore fomni
Non abſunt.

From wars and diſcord far, and public ſtrife,
Earth with ſalubrious fruits ſupports their life:
Tho' high-arch'd domes, tho' marble halls they
want,
And columns cas’d in gold and elephant,
In aweful ranks where brazen ſtatues ſtand,
The poliſh'd works of Grecia’s ſkilful hand;
Nor dazzling palace view, whoſe portals proud
Each morning vomit out the cringing crowd;
Nor wear the tiſſu'd garment's cumb'rous pride,
Nor ſeek ſoft wool in Syrian purple dy'd,
Nor with fantaſtic luxury defile
The native ſweetneſs of the liquid oil ;
Yet calm content, fecure from guilty cares,
Yet home-felt pleaſure, peace, and reſt, are theirs;
Leiſure and eaſe, in groves, and cooling vales,
Grottos, and bubbling brooks, and darkſome dales;
The lowing oxen, and the bleating ſheep,
And, under branching trees, delicious Neep!
There foreſts, lawns, and haunts of beaſts abound,
There youth is temperate, and laborious found;
There altars and the righteous gods are fear’d,
And aged fires by duteous fons rever'd ;
There juſtice linger'd ere ſhe fled mankind,
And left fome traces of her reign behind !
XVI. Compariſon beautifully ſets off and illuſtrates
one thing by reſembling and comparing it to an-
other, to which it bears a manifeſt relation and re-
ſemblance :
-She never told her love,
But let concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,
Feed on her damalk cheek: fhe pin'd in thought,
And fate, like patience on a monument,
Smiling at grief.
Shakeſpeare.
The poet wonderfully praiſes the bravery of his
hero, with perfect ſerenity and preſence of mind,
giving orders of battle in the hurry and heat of the
bloody action, when he compares him to an angel
riding

riding upon the wings of the wind, and directing a
form where to pour out his fury:
So when an angel, by divine command,
With rifing tempeſts ſhakes a guilty land,
(Such as of late o'er pale Britannia paſt)
Calm and ferene he drives the furious blaſt;
And glad th' Almighty's orders to perform,
Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the ſtorin *.
Compariſons mightily ſtrengthen and beautify a
diſcourſe ; for ſome time take off the reader from the
principal ſubject, and ſtart new and agreeable images
to divert and entertain him, that he may return to
it with freſh pleaſure and eagerneſs. In Compariſon
theſe things are to be obſerved.
1. The chief and eilential parts of the Compari-
fon must bear an exact and true proportion. Soine
ſmall diſagreement in a leſs conſiderable circumſtance
will not fpoil the grace, nor take away the ſtrength
of the Figure. Though the greater agreement and
exacter parallel there is in all particulars, the more
lively the Figure is. And therefore, generally ſpeak.
ing, Compariſons ought to be ſhort. In running
into minute circumſtances, beſides the tediouſneſs,
there is danger of diſcovering fome unagreeable dif.
proportion.
2d. Compariſons need not always be drawn from
very noble and lofty ſubjects. Thoſe taken from
meaner things are ſignificant and agreeable, if they
be ſet off in noble words, if they give clear notions,
and paint in ſtrong and fine colours the thing we in-
tend to repreſent by them. In great ſubjects, Com-
pariſons from leſſer things relieve and refreſh the
mind; as when Shakeſpeare illuſtrates the govern.

The art of order to a peopled kingdom.

Where ſome, like magiſtrates, correct at home;
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad;

Her whip of cricket's bone; the laſh, of film;
Her waggoner, a ſmall grey-coated gnat,
Not half ſo big as a round little worm,
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazle nut,
Made by the joiner ſquirrel, or old grub,
Time out of mind, the Fairies coachmakers.
And in this ſtate the gallops, night by night,
Through lovers brains, and then they dream of love;
On courtiers knees, that dream on curt’lies ſtrait;
O’er lawyers fingers, who ítrait dream on fees ;
O'er ladies lips who ſtrait on kiſſes dream;
Which oft the angry Mab with bliſters plagues,
Becauſe their breaths with ſweetmeats tainted are.
Sometimes ſhe gallops o'er a courtier's noſe,
And then dreams he of ſmelling out a fuit:
And ſometimes comes ſhe with a tythe-pig's tail,
Tickling the parſon as he lies atleep;
Then dreams he of another benefice.
Sometimes ſhe driveth o'er a ſoldier's neck,
And then he dreams of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuſcadoes, Spaniſh blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ears, at which he ſtarts and wakes ;
And being thus frighted, ſwears a prayer or two,
And ſleeps again.
In Deſcriptions a judicious author will omit low
and vulgar circumſtances, and chiefly beſtow his pains
to complete and beautify all the effential and malterly
ſtrokes. It is the manner of little verſifiers to take
every hint that preſents itſelf, and run out into long
common places. A writer that would live and pleaſe,
will cut off ſuperfluities, and reject the moſt pleaſing
thoughts and forid lines which would come in abrupt-
ly, and quite foreign to his ſubject. Many things
muſt be left to the imagination of the reader, and
ſeaſonable filence has its emphafis. Virgil tells his
reader, that Eurydice was killed by a ſerpent lurk-
ing in a bank, but ſays nothing more of that veno-

mous creature. A poetafter would probably have
ſpent as many lines in a horrid Deſcription of it, as
compoſe that admirable poem: but that divine poet
knew there was no room for ſuch a liberty here : his
deſign, in this ſhort and exquiſite piece, being only
to give a moving pattern of true conjugal affection,
and to thew the rapturous force which good muſic
and poetry have over the moſt fierce and ſavage
tempers.
But he deſcribes the two ſerpents which deſtroyed
Laocoon and his fons in ſuch particular circumſtances,
and paints the devouring monſters in ſuch ſtrong and

and give his reader a due notion of the diſpleaſure of
the gods againſt Troy, which was fo fixed and implaa
cable, that they thus ſignally cut off an innocent man

The poet, or orator, upon theſe occaſions is ſo
fully poſſeſſed of, and vehemently intent upon,
his
ſubject, that he is really tranſported with thoſe
paſſions which he would inſpire his readers or hearers
with ; and by that ftrength and noble enthufiafın of
imagination,' he is happily qualified to captivate
their affections. A commanding genius can impreſs
his own Images upon thoſe he addreſſes ; can move

XIX. Proſopopoeia, perſonifying, or raiſing qua-
lities or things inanimate into perſons, has two parts.

things inanimate are introduced in diſcourſe, and de-
fcribed as living and rational beings. Virtue and
Pleature addreſs young Hercules as two bright ladies
of oppoſite parties; the one would fain induce him
to decline the toils of war, and indulge himſelf in
eaſe and luxury: the other earneſtly exhorts him to

August ſhe trod, yet modeſt was her air;
Serene her eye, yet darting heavenly fire,
Still ſhe drew near; and nearer till more fair,
More mild appear'd: yet ſuch as might inſpire
Pleaſure corrected with an awful fear;
Majeſtically ſweet, and amiably ſevere.
The other dame ſeem'd of a fairer hue;
But bold her mien ; unguarded rov'd her eye:
And her fuſh'd cheek confeſs’d at nearer view,
The borrowed bluſhes of an artful die.

Lightly the danc'd along; her robe betray'd

Heightening the charms it only ſeein'd to ſhade :
And as it flow'd adown, ſo looſe and thin,
Her ſtature ſhew'd more tall, more ſnowy-white

And in the fame poem, how animated and ſtriking
is the Deſcription of their different effects and conſe-
quences, by being put into the mouth of Virtue as a
perſon, and addreſſed to Vice as a perſon alſo!
Vaft happineſs, enjoy thy gay allies !
A youth of follies, an old age
of cares :
Young, yet enervate; old, yet never wiſe ;
Vice waſtes their vigour, and their mind impairs.
Vain, idle, delicate, in thoughtleſs eaſe,
Reſerving woes for age, their prime they ſpend;
All wretched, hopeleſs, in the evil days
With forrow to the verge of life they tend,
Griev'd with the preſent; of the paſt afham'd;
They live, and are deſpis’d; they die, no more are
nam'd.

it is dangerous and ridiculous to uſe it, but when the

a noble vehemence. A man of underſtanding will
keep his boldeſt flights within the bounds of com-
mon ſenſe; and guide himſelf by the rules of pro-
bability and decorum in his moſt adventurous fallies
of imagination. It is very tender and moving when,
in paſtoral and mourning poems, rivers, groves, and
mountains are brought in linguiſhing for the abſence,
or lamenting the loſs, of ſome very valuable perſon,
that before frequented them and cheered them with
his preſence :
No more the mounting larks, while Daphne fings,
Shall liftning in mid air ſuſpend their wings;
No more the nightingales repeat their lays,
huſh'd with wonder, hearken from their ſprays;
No more the ſtreams their murmurs ſhall forbear,
A fiveeter muſic than their own to hear;
But tell the reeds, and tell the vocal ſhore,
Fair Daphne's dead, and muſic is no more !
Her fate is whiſper'd ly the gentle breeze,
And told in fighs to all the trembling trees ;
The trembling trees in every plain and wood,
Her fate remurmur to the ſilver flood;

Swell’d with new paſſion, and o'ernows with tears ;
The winds, and trees, and floods her death deplore,

“ paſt day muſt give pain or pleaſure, according to
the manner in which it has been ſpent.” But
what a difference in the impreſſion that they make!
XX. Change of Time is when things done and
paſt are deſcribed as now doing and preſent. This
form of expreſſion places the thing to be repreſented
in a ſtrong and prevalent light before us, and makes
us ſpectators rather than hearers :
My mother, with that curſt partaker of her bed,
My royal father's head in pieces cleaves,
As ſturdy woodmen fell a ſtately oak:
By treaſon's blow the victor hero falls
To woman's rage, and coward's guilt, a victim.
While thus the lord of Greece expiring lies,
No pity touches any breaſt but mine.
Ele&t. of Soph.
Here the princeſs preſents you with a mournful
ſcene of Agamemnon's murder, and gives you a
view of the horrors of that guilty night and bloody
ſupper. She moves every generous breaſt to fym-
pathiſe with her; to boil with indignation againſt
the treacherous and barbarous murderers; and bleed
with compaſſion for the royal ſufferer.

XXI. Change of perſons has ſome variety. It is
moſt commonly when the writer on a ſudden breaks
off his relation, and addreſſes his reader.
Again a fierce engagement by the ſhips aroſe ;
You'd think that neither wearineſs nor wounds
Could teach the fearleſs warriors.
Iliad. XV.
This Figure, when we have it in perfection, takes-
off the tediouſneſs of a long direct narration; makes
the reader attentive, as if he ſaw the place where the
thing was tranſacted ; and raiſes his paſſions, as if he
himſelf was in the hurry and heat of the action.
It is of peculiar grace and advantage in the dea
fcription of places ; it leads the reader pleaſantly into
them; heightens his imagination ; and, to uſe a bold
expreffion, gives him the delight of ſafe and eaſy
travelling in a fine country. Sometimes, for variety's
fake, to ſmooth a harſh expreſſion, to pay reverence
to the reader, or to avoid ſuppoſing that any thing
may happen which is ſhocking or of dangerous con-
ſequence, the author appropriates and applies that
to himſelf, which he deſigns for the reader's warning
or inſtruction. So Virgil of the miſchievous ſerpent
in Calabria :
O! let nor fleep my cloſing eyes invade
In open plains or in the ſecret ſhade ;
When he, renew'd in all the ſpeckled pride
Of pompous youth, has caſt his flough aſide..
Dryd. Virg. Geor. iii.
Change of Perſons is common and very natural in
eager conteſts and Atrong paflions; when adverſaries
breathe mutual rage and ſcorn ; or a deſerted lover
inveighs againſt the perjuries, and aggravates the:
barbarity of the guilty and treacherous perſon.
Turnus in Virgil, enraged at the malicious ha..

council, then attacks Drances again with a variety
of ſevere and ſatirical language.
Dido, upon notice of the departure of Æneas, diſ-
tracted with rage and deſpair, first furiouſly falls upon
him, then diſdainfully turning from him, ſpeaks of
him as an abſent perfon; after exclaims againit the
cruelty of heaven and earth; then reproaches and
condems herfelf for her own credulity and weakneſs,
and again with ſcorn and eager indignation turns her
fpeech to Æneas :
Falſe as thou art, and more than falſe, forſworn;
Not ſprung from noble blood, nor goddeſs-born;
Why ſhould I fawn ; what have I worſe to fear?
Did he once look, or lent a liſt’ning ear ;
Sigh'd when I lobb’d, or ſhed one kindly tear?
Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;
Faithleſs is earth, and faithlefs are the ſkies !

With needful food his hungry Trojans fed :
I took the traitor to my throne and bed.

it had loſt all its ſprightlineſs and grace. After Homer
has finiſhed the narration of Hector putting to flight
the Grecians, and vehemently urging his Trojans to
purſue their advantage, and forbear the ſpoil of the
field till they had burned the enemy's ſhips ; without
any notice, he immediately makes the hero utter
his own pallion in an impetuous ſpeech; wherein he
threatens diſgrace and death to any man that ſhould
diſobey his orders, and neglect this promiſing ſeaſon
of a complete victory. The ſpeech, that breaks
from a warrior in the ſpeed of his glorious ſucceſs, in
the full proſpect of revenge upon his enemies, and
the final deliverance of his country and kingdoms
after a long and bloody war, comes rapid and refift-
lefs like a pointed ſhot out of an engine, and ſtrikes
the reader with ſurpriſe and terror.
Leaving out the heavy formality of, he ſaid, and,

Horace is extremely happy in this fort of Tran-

ſuddenly leaves the ſubject he is upon, and paſſes on

ſerves to illuſtrate and enlarge it.
Horace, in the thirteenth ode of the ſecond book,
gives us a very lively account of the danger he was
in of being deſtroyed by the fall of a tree, and after
makes wiſe and inoderate remarks on the accident.

world, upon which he was ſo near entering ; and
beautifully expatiates upon the praiſes of his illuf-

his reader of the inſtruction and pleaſure he propoſes,
but multiplies and increaſes both; nor does he ſo
much take him off from the view of his ſubject, as
he gives him a delightful proſpect of it every way, and

traveller who brings him fafely and pleaſantly to his

The man that's honeſt, wife, and brave,
In body found, in fpirit free,
If he poſſeſs what nature crave,
Is in truth as rich as he.
Fourthly. Fortify at home, and rely upon yourſelf.
For a rational mind is born to the privilege of inde-
pendence. Honeſty, and the inward quiet conſe-
quent to it, is enough in all conſcience to make you
happy,
Fifthly. Do not be fond of any thing, or think
that for your intereſt which makes you break your
word, quit your modeſty, be of a diffembling, ſuf-
picious, or outrageous humour; which puts you
upon hating any perſon, and inclines you to any
practice which will not bear the light, and look the
world in the face.
Sixthly. Believe that, if your judgment pronoun-
ces right, if your actions are friendly and well meant,
if your mind is contented and reſigned to Providence,
you are in poſſeſſion of the greateſt bleſſings.
Seventhly. Be neither ſlave nor tyrant'to any body
in your behaviour.
Eighthly. Put it out of the power of truth to give
you an ill character; and if any body reports you
not to be honeſt or good, let your practice give him
the lie.

conditions, profeſſions, and countries are forced to

I muſt tell you, if your manners be good, your for-
tune can never be bad. For, in a word, happineſs
lies all in the functions of reaſon, in warrantable
defires, and regular practice.
On the Delicacy of Taſte and Paſion.
[From Hume's Elays.]
OME people are ſubject to a certain delicacy of
paffion, which makes them extremely ſenſible
to all the accidents of life, and gives them a
lively joy upon every proſperous event, as well as a
piercing grief, when they meet with misfortunes and
adverſity. Favours and good offices eaſily engage
their friendthip, while the ſmalleſt injury provokes
their reſentment. Any honour or mark of diſtinc-
tion elevates them above meaſure; but they are as
fenfibly touched with contempt. People of this
character have, no doubt, much more lively enjoy-
ments, as well as more pungent forrows, than men
of cool and ſedate tempers: but, I believe, when
every thing is balanced, there is no one who would
not rather chooſe to be of the latter character, were
he entirely maſter of his own diſpoſition. Good or
ill fortune is very little at our own diſpołal : and
when a perſon, that has this ſenſibility of temper,
meets with any misfortune, his forrow or reſentment
takes entire poſſeſſion of him, and deprives him of all
reliſh in the common occurrences of life; of which
the right enjoyment forms the greateſt part of our
happineſs. Great pleafures are much leſs frequent
than great pains ; ſo that a ſenſible temper must meet
with fewer trials in the former way than in the latter.
Not to mention, that men of ſuch lively paſſions are
apt to be tranſported beyond all bounds of prudence
and diſcretion, and to take falſe ſteps in the conduct
of life, which are often irretrievable.
There is a delicacy of taſte obſervable in fome
men, which very much reſembles this delicacy of
paſſion,

paſſion, and provice me ſenſibility to beauty
and deformity of er i ad, as that does to proſpe-
rity and adverſity, o'sagations and injuries. When
you preſent a poem or a picture to a man poſſeſſed
of this talent, the delicacy of his feeling inakes him
be touched very ſenſibly with every part of it; nor
are the maſterly ſtrokes perceived with more exqui-
fite reliſh and fatisfaction, than the negligences or
abſurdities with diſguſt and uneaſineſs. A polite
and judicious converſation affords him the higheſt
entertainment; rudeneſs or impertinence is as great'
a puniſhment to him. In ſhort, delicacy of taſte has
the ſame effect as delicacy of paſſion : it enlarges the
ſphere both of our happineſs and miſery, and makes
us ſenſible to pains as well as pleaſures, which eſcape.
the reſt of mankind.
I believe, however, there is no one who will not
agree with me, that, notwithſtanding this reſem-
blance, a delicacy of taſte is as much to be deſired
and cultivated as a delicacy of paſſion is to be lament-
ed, and to be remedied, if poſſible. The good or ill
accidents of life are very little at our diſpoſal; but we
are pretty much maſters what books we ſhall read,
what diverfions we ſhall partake of, and what com-
pany we ſhall keep. Philoſophers have endeavoured
to render happineſs entirely independent of every
thing external. That is impoſſible to be attained :
but every wiſe man will endeavour to place his hap-
pineſs on ſuch objects as depend moſt upon himſelf;
and that is not to be attained ſo much by any other
means as by this delicacy of ſentiment.
When a
man is poſſeſſed of that talent, he is more happy by
what pleaſes his taſte, than by what gratifies his ap-
petites, and receives more enjoyment from a poem
or a piece of reaſoning, than the most expenſive
luxury can afford.
How far delicacy of taſte and that of paſſion are
connected together in the original frame of the mind,
it is hard to determine. To me there appears a very
conſiderable connection between them : for we may
obſerve

obſerve that women, who have more delicate paſſions
than men, have alſo a more delicate taſte of the or-:
naments of life, of dreſs, equipage, and the ordinary
decencies of behaviour.
Any excellency in there
hits their taſte much ſooner than ours ; and when
you pleaſe their taſte, you foon engage their af.
fections.
But whatever connection there may be originally
betwixt theſe diſpoſitions, I am perſuaded that no-
thing is ſo proper to cure us of this delicacy of paſ-
fion, as the cultivating of that higher and inore re-
fined taſte, which enables us to judge of the charac-
ters of men, of compofitions of genius, and of the
productions of the nobler arts. A greater or leſs re-
lith of thoſe obvious beauties which ſtrike the ſenſes,
depends entirely upon the greater or leſs fenfibility
of the temper: but with regard to the ſciences and
liberal arts, a fine taſte is, in fome meaſure, the
fame with itrong ſenſe, or at leaſt depends ſo much
upon it, that they are inſeparable. To judge aright
of a compofition of genius, there are ſo many views
to be taken in, ſo many circumſtances to be com-
pared, and ſuch a knowledge of human nature requi-
lite, that no man, who is not poſieſſed of the foundeſt
judgment, will ever inake a tolerable critic in ſuch
performances ; and this is a new reaſon for cultivating
à reliſh in the liberal arts. Our judgment will
ſtrengthen by this exerciſe: we ſhall form juſter
notions of life : many things which pleaſe or atiliet
others, will appear to us too frivolous to engage our
attention: and we ſhall loſe by degrees that fenfi-
bility and delicacy of paifion, which is ſo incoinmo-
dious.
But perhaps I have gone too far in ſaying, that a
cultivated taſte for the polite arts extinguiſhes the
pallions, and renders us indifferent to thoſe objects
which are ſo fondly purſued by the reſt of mankind.
On farther reflection, I find that it rather improves
our ſenſibility for all the tender and agreeable paí-
fions, at the ſame time, that it renders the mind in-
capable of the rougher and more boiſterous emotions.

Ingenuas didiciſſe fideliter artes,
Emollit mores, nec finit efle feros.
For this I think there may be aſſigned two very na-
tural reaſons. In the firſt place, nothing is ſo im-
proving to the temper as the ſtudy of the beauties
either of poetry, eloquence, muſic, or painting ;
they give a certain elegance of ſentiment, to which
the reſt of mankind are entire ſtrangers. The emo-
tions they excite are ſoft and tender. They draw the
mind off from the hurry of buſineſs and intereſt ;
cheriſh reflection ; difpofe to tranquillity; and pro-
duce an agreeable melancholy, which, of all diſpo-
fitions of the mind, is the beſt ſuited to love and
friendſhip.
In the ſecond place, a delicacy of taſte is favour-
able to love and friendſhip, - by confining our choice
to few people, and making us indifferent to the com-
pany and converſation of the greateſt part of men.
You will very ſeldom find that mere men of the
world, whatever ſtrong ſenſe they may be endowed
with, are very nice in diſtinguiſhing of characters,
or in marking thoſe inſenſible differences and grada-
tions which make one man preferable to another.
Any one, that has competent ſenſe, is ſufficient for
their entertainment : they talk to him of their plea-
ſure and affairs, with the ſame frankneſs as they
would to another; and finding many who are fit to
ſupply this place, they never feel any vacancy or
want in his abſence. But to make uſe of the allu-
fion of a celebrated French author *, the judgment
may be compared to a clock or watch, where the
moſt ordinary machine is fufficient to tell the hours ;
but the moſt elaborate and artificial alone can point
out the minutes and ſeconds, and diſtinguiſh the
finalleſt differences of time. One that has well di-
geſted his knowledge both of books and men, has
little enjoyment but in the company of a few ſelect

companions. He feels too ſenſibly how much all
the reſt of mankind fall ſhort of the notions which
he has entertained ; and, his affections being thus
confined within a narrow circle, no wonder he carries
them further than if they were more general and un-
diſtinguiſhed. The gaiety and frolic of a bottle-com-
panion improves with him into a ſolid friendſhip ;
and the ardours of a youthful appetite becoine an ele-
gant paſſion.
On Impudence and Modeſty.
[From Hume's Elays.]
AM of opinion that the common complaints
I
good or bad qualities of men are the cauſes of their
good or bad fortune, more than what is generally
imagined. There are, no doubt, inſtances to the
contrary, and theſe too pretty numerous; but few,
in compariſon of the inſtances we have of a right
diſtribution of proſperity and adverſity : nor indeed
could it be otherwiſe from the common courſe of
human affairs. To be endowed with a benevolent
difpofition, and to love others, will almoſt infallibly
procure love and eſteem; which is the chief circun.
itance in life, and facilitates every enterpriſe and
undertaking, beſides the ſatisfaction which immedi-
ately reſults from it. The caſe is much the ſame
with the other virtues. Proſperity is naturally,
though not neceſſarily, attached to virtue and merit;
and adverſity, in like manner, to vice and folly.
I muſt, however, confeſs, that this rule' admits
of an exception with regard to one moral quality;
and that inodeſty has a natural tendency to conceal
a man's talents, as impudence diſplays them to the
ytmoſt, and has been the only cauſe why many
have
riſen in the world, under all the diſadvantages of low
birth and little merit. Such indolence and incapa-
city is there in the generality of mankind, that they
are apt to receive a man for whatever he has a mind

to put himſelf off for; and admit his overbearing airs
as proofs of that merit which he aſſumes to himſelf.
A decent aſſurance ſeems to be the natural attendant
of virtue; and few men can diſtinguiſh impudence
from it: as, on the other hand, diffidence, being the
natural reſult of vice and folly, has drawn diſgrace
upon modeſty, which in outward appearance ſo
nearly reſembles it.
As impudence, though really a vice, has the fame
effects upon a man's fortune as if it were a virtue ;
ſo we may obſerve that it is almoſt as difficult to be
attained, and is, in that reſpect, diſtinguiſhed from
all the other vices, which are acquired with little
pains, and continually increaſe upon indulgence.
Many a man, being ſenſible that modeſty is extremely
prejudicial to him in making his fortune, has reſolved
to be impudent, and to put a bold face upon the
matter: but it is obſervable that ſuch people have
ſeldom fucceeded in the attempt, but have been
obliged to relapſe into their primitive modeſty. No-
thing carries a man through the world like a true
genuine natural impudence: its counterfeit is good
for nothing, nor can ever ſupport itſelf. In any
other attempt, whatever faults a man commits, and
is ſenſible of, he is ſo much the nearer his end: but
when he endeavours at impudence, if he ever failed
in the attempt, the remembrance of that failure will
make him bluſh, and will infallibly diſconcert him :
after which every bluſh is a cauſe for new bluſhes,
till he be found out to be an arrant cheat, and a vain
pretender to impudence.
If any thing can give a modeſt man more affu-
rance, it muſt be ſome advantages of fortune, which
chance procures to him. Riches naturally gain a
man a favourable reception in the world, and give
inerit a double luſtre, when a perſon is endowed with
it ; and fupply its place, in a great meaſure, when
it is abſent. It is wonderful to obſerve what airs of
ſuperiority fools and knaves, with large poffeflions,
give themſelves above men of the greateſt merit in
poverty. Nor do the men of merit make any ſtrong

oppoſition to theſe uſurpations, or rather ſeem to
favour them by the modeſty of their behaviour.
Their good ſenſe and experience make them diffi-

the practice of the world that integrity of virtue, ſo
to ſpeak, of which they are ſo jealous. To make
wiſdom
agree
with confidence, is as difficult as to re-
concile vice and modeity.
Theſe are the reflections which have occurred upon
this ſubject of impudence and modeſty; and I hope
the reader will not be diſpleaſed to ſee them wrought
into the following allegory,

world. But though he thought he had matched
them with great judgment, and ſaid that Confidence
was the natural companion of Virtue, and that Vice
deſerved to be attended with Diffidence, they had
not gone far before diffention aroſe among them.
Wiſdom, who was the guide of the one company,
was always accuſtomed before the ventured upon any
road, however beaten, to examine it carefully; to inquire
whither it led; what dangers, difficulties, and hin-
drances might poſſibly or probably occurin it. In theſe
deliberations the uſually conſumed ſome time; which
delay was very difplending to Confidence, who was
always inclined to hurry on, without much fore-
thought or deliberation, in the first road he met.
Wiſdom and Virtue were inſeparable: but Confi-
dence one day, following his impetuous nature, ad-
vanced a conſiderable way before his guides and com-
panions; and not feeling any want of their company,
he never: inquired after them, nor ever met with
them more. In like manner the other ſociety,
though joined by Jupiter, diſagreed and ſeparated.

and this want of reſolution was increaſed by Diffi.
dence, who, with her doubts and ſcruples, always
retarded the journey. This was a great annoyance
to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties and
delays, and was never ſatisfied without his full career,
in whatever his inclinations led him to. Folly, he
knew, though ſhe hearkened to Diffidence, would
be eafily managed when alone; and therefore, as a
vicious horſe throws his rider, he openly beat away
this controller of all his pleaſures, and proceeded in
his journey with Folly, from whom he is inſeparable.
Confidence and Diffidence being, after this manner,
both thrown looſe from their reſpective companies,
wandered for ſome time; till at last chance led them
at the ſame time to one village. Confidence went
directly up to the great houſe, which belonged to
Wealth, the lord of the village; and, without ſtay.

the innerınoſt apartments, where he found Vice and
Folly well received before him. He joined the
train; recommended himſelf very quickly to his
landlord; and entered into ſuch familiarity with
Vice, that he was inliſted in the ſame company with
Folly. They were frequent gueſts of Wealth, and
from that moment infeparable. Diffidence, in the
meantime, not daring to approach the great houſe,
accepted of an invitation from Poverty, one of the
tenants; and entering the cottage, found Wiſdom
and Virtue, who, being repulfed by the landlord,
had retired thither. Virtue took compaſſion on her,
and Wiſdom found, from her temper, that ſhe would
eaſily improve: ſo they admitted her into their
ſociety: Accordingly, by their means, ſhe altered
in a little time ſomewhat of her manner, and be-
coming much inore amiable and engaging, was now
known by the name of Modeſty. As ill company
has a greater effect than good, Confidence, though
more refractory to counſel and example, degenerated
ſo far by the ſociety of Vice and Foily, as to paſs

Of Superftition and Enthuſiaſm.
HAT the corruption of the beſt things pro-
duces the worſt, is grown into a maxim, and
is commonly proved, among other inſtances, by the
pernicious effects of Superſtition and Enthuſiaſm,
the corruptions of true religion.
Theſe two ſpecies of falſe religion, though both
pernicious, are yet of a very different, and even of
a contrary nature. The mind of man is ſubject to
certain unaccountable terrors and apprehenſions, pro-
ceeding either from the unhappy lituation of private
or public affairs, from ill health, from a gloomy and
melancholy diſpoſition, or from the concurrence of
all theſe circumſtances. In ſuch a ſtate of mind, in-
finite unknown evils are dreaded from unknown
agents; and, where real objects of terror are want-
ing, the ſoul, active to its own prejudice, and foſter-
ing its predominant inclination, finds imaginary ones,
to whoſe power and malevolence it fets no limits. As
theſe enemies are entirely inviſible and unknown,
the methods taken to appeaſe them are equally un-
accountable, and conſiſt in ceremonies, oblervance's,
mortifications, facrifices, preſents, or in any prac-
tice, however abſurd or frivolous, which either folly
or knavery recommends to a blind and terrified cre-
dulity. - Weakneſs, fear, melancholy, together with
ignorance, are, therefore, the true lources of Super-
Itition.
But the mind of man is alſo ſubject to an unac-
countable elevation and preſumption, proceeding
from proſperous ſucceſs, from luxuriant health, from
ſtrong fpirits, or from a bold and confident diſpoſi-
tion. In ſuch a ſtate of mind, the imagination

gether unaccountable, and ſeeming guite beyond the
reach of our ordinary faculties, are attributed to the
immediate inſpiration of that Divine Being, who is
the object of devotion. In a little time the inſpired
perſon comes to regard himſelf as the chief favourite
of the Divinity; and when this frenzy once takes
place, which is the ſummit of Enthuſiaſın, every
whimſey is conſecrated: human reaſon and even mo-
rality are rejected as fallacious guides : and the fanatic
madman delivers himſelf over, blindly, and without
reſerve, to the ſuppoſed illapſes of the ſpirit, and to
inſpirations from above. Hope, pride, preſuinp-
tion, a warm imagination, together with ignorance,
are, therefore, the true ſources of Enthufiaſm.

A Dialogue between Mr. Addiſon and Dr. Swift.

URELY, Addiſon, fortune was ex-
ceedingly bent upon playing the fool
(a humour her lady ſhip, as well as most other ladies
of very great quality, is frequently in) when ſhe
made you a miniſter of ſtate, and me a divine !
Addiſon. I muſt confeſs we were both of us out of
our elements. But you do not mean to infinuate,
that, if our deſtinies had been reverſed, all would
have been right?

cellent bifhop, and I ſhould have governed Great-

I talked of nothing but liberty, property, and ſo

Addiſon. You governed the mob of Ireland; but
I'never heard that you governed the kingdom. A
nation and a mob are different things.
Swift. Aye; ſo you fellows that have no ge.
nius for politics may ſuppoſe. But there are times
when, by putting himſelf at the head of the mob,
an able man may get to the head of the nation. Nay,
there are times when the nation itſelf is a mob, and
may be treated as ſuch by a ſkilful obſerver. -
Addiſon. I do not deny the truth of your axiom :
but is there no danger that, from the viciſſitudes of
human affairs, the favourite of the mob ſhould be
mobbed in his turn?.
Swift. Sometimes there may; but I riſked it, and
it anſwered my purpoſe.". Aik the lord-lieutenants,
who were forced to pay court to me inſtead of my
courting them, whether they did not feel my ſupe-
riority. And if I could make myſelf ſo confiderable
when I was only a dirty dean of St. Patrick's, with-
out a ſeat in either houſe of parliament, what ſhould
I have done if fortune had placed me in England,
unincumbered with a gown, and in a ſituation to
make myſelf heard in the houſe of lords or of com-
mons ?
Add'fon. You would doubtleſs have done very
marvellous acts! perhaps you might have then been
as zealous a whig as Lord Wharton himſelf :
the whigs had offended the ſtateſinan, as they un-
happily did the doctor, who knows but you might
have brought in the Pretender ? pray let me aſk you :
one queſtion between you and me : if you had been
firſt miniſter under that prince, would you have to-
lerated the Proteſtant religion, or not?
Swift. Ha ! Mr. Secretary, are you witty upon
me? do you think, becauſe Sunderland took a fancy
to make you a great man in the ſtate, that he could
alſo make you aš great in wit as nature made me?
No, no,; wit is like grace, it muſt come from above.

Apollo perhaps would have given a different judg-

but before I was a man I returned to my country-
men, the valiant Mohawks; and being cheated by
one of your's in the ſale of ſome rum, I never cared
to have any thing to do with them afterwards. Yet
I took up the hatchet for them with the rest of my
tribe in the war again!t France, and was killed while
I was out upon a felping party. But I died very
well fatisfied: für my friends were victorious, and be-

mine had lent me ſome money. After two or three
years, being in great want himſelf, he aſked me to

Savage. Eat! Did you ever eat the chine of a
Frenchman, or his leg, or his ſhoulder ? there is
fine eating! I have eat twenty. My table was always
well ferved. My wife was the beſt cook for the
dreſſing of man's fleſh in all North-America. You

would make thee caper and leap like a buck. But

Duellift. O heavens! inuſt I bear this! what can I

extracts, as if all had been ſafe and quiet about
you,
was an abſurd affectation. To meet dan yer with
courage is the part of a man, but to be inſenſible
of it is brutal ſtupidity; and to pretend inſenſibility,
where it cannot exiſt, is ridiculous falleneſs. When
you afterwards refuſed to leave your aged mother,
and ſave yourſelf without her by flight, you indeed
acted nobly:
It was alſo becoming a Roman to keep
up her ſpirits, amidſt all the horrors of that dreadful
ſcene, by thewing yourſelf undiſmayed and coura-
geous. But the merit and glory of this part
of
your
conduct is funk by the other, which gives an air of
oftentation and vanity to the whole.
Pliny the Younger. That vulgar minds ſhould fup-
poſe my attention to my ſtudies in ſuch a con-
juncture unnatural and affected, I ſhould not much
wonder: but that you would blame it as ſuch, I did
not expect; you, who approached ſtill ne.irer than
I to the fiery itorm, and died by the ſuffocating heat
of the vapour.
Pliny the Elder. I died, as a good and brave man
ought to die, in doing my duty. Let me recall to
your memory all the particulars, and then you ſhall
judge yourſelf on the difference of your conduct and
mine. I was the præfect of the Roman fleet which
then lay at Miſenum. Upon the firſt account I re-
ceived of the very unuſual cloud that appeared in
the air, I ordered a veſſel to carry me out to ſome
diſtance from the ſhore, that I might the better ob-
ſerve the phenomenon, and try to diſcover its nl-
ture and cauſe. This I did as a philofopher, and it
was a curioſity proper and natural to a ſearching,
inquiſitive mind." I offered to take

ſea, as the ſafeſt retreat. To aſſiſt them, and all
others who dwelt on the coaſt, I immediately order-
ed the fleet to put out, and failed with it round the
whole Bay of Naples, ſteering particularly to thoſe
parts of the ſhore where the danger was greateſt, and
from whence the inhabitants were endeavouring to
eſcape with the moſt trepidation. Thus I ſpent the
whole day, and preſerved by my care ſome thouſands
of lives; noting, at the fame time, with a ſteady
compoſure and freedom of mind, the ſeveral forms
and phenomena of the eruption. Towards night,
as we approached to the foot of Veſuvius, all the
gallies were covered with aſhes and embers, which grew
hotter and hotter; then ſhowers of pumice ſtones and
burnt and broken Pyrites began to fall on our heads;
and we were ſtopped by the obſtacles which the ruins
of the mountain had ſuddenly formed by falling into
the ſea, and almoſt filling it up on that part of the
coaſt. I then commanded my pilot to ſteer to the
villa of my friend Pomponianus, which you know
was ſituated in the inmoſt receſs of the Bay. The
wind was very favourable to carry me thither, but
would not allow him to put off from the ſhore, as he
wiſhed to have done. We were therefore conſtrained
to paſs the night in his houſe. They watched, and
I ſlept, until the heaps of pumice ſtones, which fell
from the clouds, that had now been impelled to that
fide of the Bay, roſe ſo high in the area of the apart-
ment I lay in, that I could not have got out had I
ſtaid any longer; and the earthquakes were ſo vio-
lent, as to threaten every moment the fall of the
houſe: we therefore thought it more ſafe to go into
the open air, guarding our heads as well as we
could with pillows tied upon them. The wind con-
tinuing adverſe, and the lea very rough, we remain-
ed on the ſhore, until a fulphureous and fiery vapour
opprefled my weak lungs, and ended my life.--In
all this I hope that I acted as the duty of my
ſtation
required, and with true magnanimity. But on this

muſt ſay, my dear nephew, that there was a vanity
mixed with your virtue, which hurt and diſgraced
it. Without that, you would have been one of the
worthieit men that Rome has produced; for none
ever excelled you in the integrity of your heart and
greatneſs of your ſentiments. Why would you loſe
the ſubſtance of glory by ſeeking the ſhadow ? Your
eloquence had the ſame fault as your manners : it
was too affected. You profefled to make Cicero
your guide and your pattern: but when one reads
his panegyric upon Julius Cæſar, in his oration for
Marcellus, and yours upon Trajan, the firſt ſeems
the language of nature and truth, raiſed and dignified
with all the majeſty of the moſt ſublime eloquence :
the latter appears the ſtudied harangue of a florid
rhetorician, more deſirous to ſhine and ſet off his
own wit, than to extol the great man he was praiſing.
Pliny the Younger. I have too high a reſpect for
you, uncle, to queſtion your judgment either of my
life or my writings; they might both have been
better, if I had not been too folicitous to render
them perfect. But it is not for me to fay much on
that ſubject: permit me therefore to return to the
ſubject on which we began our converſation. What
a direful calamity was the eruption of Veſuvius,
which you have now been deſcribing? Do not you
remember the beauty of that charming coait, and
of the mountain itſelf, before it was broken and torn
with the violence of thoſe ſudden fires that forced
their way through it, and carried deſolation and ruin
over all the neighbouring country? the foot of it
was covered with corn fields and rich meadows, in-
terperſed with fine villas and magnificent towns :
the ſides of it were cloathed with the beſt vines in
Italy, producing the richeſt and nobleſt wines. How
quick, how unexpected, how dreadful the change!
ail was at once overwhelmed with aſhes and cinders
and fiery torrents, preſenting to the eye the moſt
diſmal ſcene of horror and deitruction !
Pliny the Elder. You paint it very truly.--But

A Dialogue between M. Apicius and Darteneuf.
[From the Dialogues of the Dead.]
LAS! poor Apicius I pity thee
much for not having lived in my
age
and
my country. How many good diſhes have
I eat in England that were unknown at Rome in
thy days!
Apicius. Keep your pity for yourſelf. How
many good diſhes have I eat in Rome, the know-
ledge of which has been loſt in theſe latter degene-
rate days! the fat paps of a fow, the livers of ſcari,
the brains of phenicopters, and the tripotanum,
which conſiſted of three forts of fiſh for which you
have no names, the lupus marinus, the myxo, and
the murx11a.
Darteneuf. I thought the muræna had been our
lamprey. We have excellent ones in the Severn.
Apicius. No:-the muræna was a falt-water fiſh,
and kept in ponds into which the ſea was admitted.
Dariencnf. Why then I dare ſay our lampreys are
Fetter. Did you ever eat any of them potted or
fewed ?
Apicius. I was never in Britain. Your country
then was too barbarous for me to go thither. I
ſhould have been afraid that the Britons would have
eat me.
Darteneuf. I am ſorry for you, very forry: for
if you never were in Britain, you nerer eat the beſt
oyſters in the whole world.

were brought to Rome in my time.
Darteneuf. They could not be freſh: they were
good for nothing there.--You ſhould have come to
Sandwich to eat them. It is a ſhame for you that
you did not.--An Epicure talk of danger when he is
in ſearch of a dainty! did not Leander ſwim over
the Helleſpont to get to his miſtreſs? and what is a
wench to a barrel of excellent oyiters ?
Apicius. Nay-I am ſure you cannot blame me
for any want of alertneſs in ſeeking fine fiſhes. I
failed to the coaſt of Afric, from Minturnæ in Cam-
pania, only to taite of one fpecies, which I heard
was larger there than it was on our coaſt, and finding
that I had received a falſe information, I returned
again without deigning to land.
Darteneuf. There was ſome ſenſe in that: but
why did you not alſo make a voyage to Sandwich ?

would never have come back: you would have eat

Apicius. I wiſh I had :-It would have been better
than poiſoning myſelf, as I did, becauſe, when I
came to make up my accounts, I found I had not
much above the poor ſum of fourſcore thoufand
pounds left, which would not afford me a table to
keep me from ſtarving.
Darteneuf. A ſum of fourſcore thouſand pounds
not keep you from ſtarving! would I had had it! I
ſhould not have ſpent it in twenty years, though I
had kept the beſt table in London, Tuppofing I had
made no other expence.

Engliſh have no idea of the luxury that reigned in
our tables. Before I died I had ſpent in my kitchen

Darteneuf. Would I had fupped with him there!
but is there no blunder in theſe calculations ?
Apicius. Aſk your learned men that.--I count as
they tell me.--But perhaps you may think that theſe
feaſts were only made by great men, like Lucullus,
who had plundered all Aſia to help him in his houſe-
keeping. What will you ſay when I tell that
the player Æfopus had one diſh that coſt hiin 6000
ſeſtertia, that is 4843 1. 10s. Engliſh.
Darteneuf. What will I ſay? why, that I pity
poor Cibber and Booth; and that, if I had known
this when I was alive, I ſhould have hanged myſelf
for vexation that I did not live in thoſe days.
Apicius. Well you might, well you might.-You
do not know what' eating is. You never could know
it.
Nothing leſs than the wealth of the Roman em-
pire is ſufficient to enable a man to keep a good
table. Our players were richer' by far than your
princes.
Darteneuf. Oh that I had but lived in the bleſſed
reign of Caligula, or of Vitellius, or of Heliogaba-
lùs, and had been admitted to the honour of dining
with their ſlaves !
Apicius. Aye, there you touch me.- I am miſer-
able that I died before their good times. They
carried the glories of their table much farther than
the beſt eaters of the age that I lived in. Vitellius
ſpent in eating and drinking within one year, what
would amount in your money to above ſeven millions
two hundred thouſand pounds. He told me ſo him-
felf in a converſation I had with him not long ago.
And the others you mentioned did not fall ſhort of
his royal magnificence.
Dartencuf. Theſe indeed were great princes. But
what affects me moſt is the diſh of that player, that
damned fellow Æfopus. I cannot bear to think of
his having lived fo much better than 1. Pray, of
what ingredients might the diſh he paid ſo much for
confist?

!
Apicius. Chiefly of ſinging birds. It was that
which ſo greatly enhanced the price.
Darteneuf. Of ſinging birds! choak him.- I never
eat but one, which I ſtole from a lady of my ac-
quaintance, and all London was in an uproar about
it, as if I h.d ſtolen and roaſted a child.
But, upon
recollection, I begin to doubt whether I have ſo
much reaſon to envy Ælopus; for the finging bird
which I eat was no better in its taſte than a fat lark
or thruſh.
It was not ſo good as a wheatear or be-
cafigue; and therefore I ſuſpect that all the luxury
you have bragged of was nothing but vanity and
fooliſh expence. It was like that of the ſon of Æfo-
pus, who diſſolved pearls in vinegar, and drunk
them at ſupper. I will be damned if a haunch of
niſon and my favourite hain pye were not much
better diſhes than any at the table of Vitellius him-
ſelf. I do not find that you had ever any good ſoups,
without which no man of taite can poſſibly dine.
The rabits in Italy are not fit to eat ; and what is
better than the wing of one of our Engliſh wild rab-
bits? I have been told that you had no turkies.
The mutton in Italy is
very
ill favoured ; and as
for your boars roated whole, I defpife them; they
were only fit to be ſerved up to the mob at a corpo-
ration feait or election dinner. A finall barbecued
hog is worth a hundred of them; and a good collar
of Shrewſbury brawn is a much better diſh.
lpicius. If you had ſome kinds of meat that we
wanled, yet our cookery muſt have been greatly ſu-
perior to yours. Our cooks were ſo excellent that
they could give to hog's fleſh the taſte of all other
mcats.
Darteneuf. I ſhould not have liked their damned
imitations. You might as eaſily have impoſed on a
good connoiffeur the copy of a fine picture for the
original. Our cooks, on the contrary, give to all
other meats a rich flavour of bacon, without deſtroy-
ing that which makes the diſtinction of one from
another. I have not the leaſt doubt that our eſſence
of hams is a much better ſauce than any that ever was

the compoſition of which exceeds all deſcription.
Had yours been as good, you could not have lolled,
as you did, upon couches, while you were eating.
They would have made you fit up and attend to
your buſineſs. Then you had a cuſtom of hearing
things re.id to you while you were at ſupper. This
Thews you were not ſo well entertained as we are
with our meat. For my own part, when I was at
table I could mind nothing elle : I neither heard,
faw, nor ſpoke : I only ſmelt and taſted. But the
worſt of all is, that you had no wine fit to be named
with good Claret, or Burgundy, or Champagne, or
Old Hock, or Tokay. You boaſted much of your Fa-
lernum ; but I have taſted the Lachrymæ Chriſti,
and other wines that grow upon the ſame coaſt, not
one of which would I drink above a glaſs or two of,
if you would give me the kingdom of Naples. You
boiled your wines and mixed water with them, which
ſhews that in themſelves they were not fit to drink.
Apicius. I am afraid you beat us in wines ; not
to mention your cyder, perry, and beer, of all
which I have heard great fame from fome Engliſh,
with whom I have talked ; and their
report
has been
confirmed by the teſtimony of their neighbours who
have travelled into England. Wonderful things have
been alſo ſaid to me of a liquor called Punch.
Darteneuf. Aye—to have died without taſting
that is unhappy indeed! There is rum punch and
arrack punch! it is hard to ſay which is beſt : bút
Jupiter would have given his nectar for either of
them, upon my word and honour.
Apicius. The thought of it puts me into a fever
with thirſt. From whence do you get your arrack
and your rum?
Darteneuf. Why, from the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies,
which you knew nothing of. That is enough to
decide the diſpute. Your trade to the Eaſt-Indies
was very far ſhort of what we carry on, and the
Weſt-Indies were not diſcovered. What a new

lumbus opened to us? Think of that, and deipair.
Apicius. I cannot indeed but lament my ill fate,
that America was not found before I was born. It
tortures me when I hear of chocolate, pine apples,
and twenty other fine meats, or fine fruits produced
there, which I have never tatted. What an advan-
tage it is to you, that all your ſweetmeats, tarts,
cakes, and other delicacies of that nature,
ſweetened with ſugar inttead of honey, which we
were obliged to make uſe of for want of that plant !
but what grieves me moſt is, that I never eat a turtle.
they tell me that it is abſolutely the beſt of all foods !
Darteneuf. Yes, I have heard the Americans ſay
fo:--but I never eat any; for in my time they
were not brought over to England.
Apicius. Never eat any turtle ! how didſt thou
dare to accuſe me of not going to Sandwich to eat
oyſters, and didît not thyſelf take a trip to America
to riot on turtles ? but know, wretched man, that I,
am informed they are now as plentiful in England
as ſturgeon. There are turtle boats that go regularly
to London and Briſtol from the Weſt-Indies. I
have juſt ſeen a fat alderman, who died in London
laſt week of a ſurfeit he got at a turtle feaſt in that
city:
Darteneuf. What does he fay? Does he tell you
that turtle is better than veniſon !
Apicius. He ſays there was a haunch of veniſon
untouched, while every mouth was employed on the
turtle: that he eat till he fell aſleep in his chair,
and that the food was ſo wholeſome he ſhould not
have died, if he had not unluckily caught cold in
his fleep, which ſtopped his perſpiration, and hurt
his digeſtion.
Darteneuf. Alas! how imperfect is human felicity!
I lived in an age when the pleaſure of eating was
thought to be carried to its highest perfection in
England and France; and yet a turtle feast is a
novelty to me! would it be impoflible, do you think,
to obtain leave from Pluto of going back for one day,

Apicius. You have forgot, Sir, that you have no
body : that which you had has been rotten a great
while ago; and you can never return to the earth
with another, unleſs Pythagoras carries you thither
to animate that of a hog. But comfort yourſelf,
that, as you have eat dainties which I never taſted,
fo the next will eat fome unknown to the preſent.
New diſcoveries will be made, and new delicacies
brought from other parts of the world. We muſt

good things we have had, and not grudge others bet-
ter if they fall to their fare, Conſider that, after
all, we could but have eat as much as our ſtomachs

Attend therefore to a diſcovery which I fall make
to you, relating to the ſubject upon which you were
talking. I know two men, one of whom lived in

you
fele real hunger, or eat one meal in twenty years
without forcing your appetites, which makes all
things infipid. I tell you therefore again, that the
ſoldier and the farmer had much more of the joy
of eating than you.
Dartencuf. This is more mortifying than not to
have ſhared a turtle feaſt. I fear indeed we have
been in quite a wrong ſyſtem, and never had any true
notions of pleaſure.
Apicius. It is a fad thing not to know what good
living is before one is dead. I wiſh, Mercury, you

Mercury. I know you have an amiable affectionate
huſband, and ſeveral fine children ; but you need
not be told that neither conjugal attachments, mater-
nal affections, nor even the care of a kingdom's wel-
fare or a nation's glory, can excuſe a perſon who

ſee I was engaged to the play on Mondays, balls on

not to keep my appointments. If you will ſtay for

waters of oblivion, who have made pleaſure the
buſineſs, end, and aim of your life! it is good to
own cares, but who would waſh away the remein
brance of a life of gaiety and pleaſure ?
Mrs. Modiſh. Diverſion was indeed the buſineſs
of my life; but as to pleaſure, I have enjoyed none
fince the novelty of my amuſements was gone off.
Can one be pleaſed with ſeeing the ſame thing over

fure, why did you continue in it? I ſuppoſe you did

you what it is not. In converſation it is not wit; in
manners it is not politeneſs ; in behaviour it is not
addreſs; but it is a little like them all. It can only
belong to people of a certain rank, who live in a
certain manner, with certain perſons who have not
certain virtues, and who have certain vices, and who
inhabit a certain part of the town. Like a place by
courteſy, it gets an higher rank than the perſon can
claim, but which thoſe who have a legal title to pre-
cedency dare not diſpute, for fear of being thought
not to underſtand the rules of politexfeſs. Now, Sir,
I have told you as much as I know of it, though I
have admired and aimed at it all my life.
Mercury. Then, Madam, you have waſted your
time, faded your beauty, and deſtroyed your health,
for the laudable purpoſes of contradicting your huſ-
band, and being this ſomething and this nothing

Mrs. Modiſh. What would you have had me do ?
Mercury. I will follow your mode of inſtructing.
I will tell you what I would not have had you do.
I would not have had you facrifice your time, your
reaſon, and your duties to faſhion and folly. I would
not have had you neglect your huſband's happineſs

Mrs. Modif:. As to my daughters' education I

to teach them behaviour and the French language.

A Dialogue between Plutarch, Charon, and a

[From the Dialogues of the Dead.]
Charon. ERE is a fellow who is very unwilling
to land in our territories. He ſays he
is rich, has a great deal of buſineſs in the other
world, and muſt needs return to it: he is ſo trouble-
ſome and obftreperous I know not what to do with
him. Take hiina under your care, therefore, good
Plutarch; you will eafily awe hiin into order and
decency by the ſuperiority an author has over a
bookſeller.
Bookfeller. Am I got into a world fo abſolutely the
reverſe of that I left, that here authors domineer
over bookſellers ? Dear Charon, let me go back, and
I will pay any price for my paſſage. But, if I muſt
ttay, leave me not with any of thoſe who are ſtyled
Claſſical Authors. As to you, Plutarch, I have a
particular animoſity againſt you, for having almoſt
occafioned my ruin. When I firſt ſet up ſhop, un.
derſtanding but little of bufineſs, I unadviſedly bought
an edition of your lives, a pack of old Greeks and
Romans, which coſt me a great ſum of money. I
could never get off above twenty ſets of them. !

fold a few to the univerſities, and ſome to Eaton and
Weſtminſter; for it is reckoned a pretty book for
boys and under-graduates; but unleſs a man has the
luck to light on a pedant he ſhall not fell a ſet of
them in twenty years,
Plutarch. From the merit of the ſubjects I had
hoped another reception for my works. I will own
indeed that I am not always perfectly accurate in
every circumſtance, nor do I give ſo exact and cire
cumſtantial a detail of the actions of my heroes, as
may be expected from a biographer who has con-
fined himſelf to one or two characters.
A zeal to
preſerve the memory of great men, and to extend
the influence of ſuch noble examples, made me un.
dertake more than I could accompliſh in the firſt de-
gree of perfection: but ſurely the characters of my
illuſtrious men are not ſo imperfectly ſketched, that
they will not ſtand forth to all ages as patterns of vir-
tue, and incitements to glory. My reflections are
allowed to be deep and ſagacious; and what can be
more uſeful to a reader than a wiſe man's judgment
on a great man's conduct? in my writings you will
find no raſh cenſures, no undeſerved encomiums, no
mean compliance with popular opinions, no vain
oftentation of critical ſkill, nor any affected fineſſe.
In my parallels, which uſed to be admired as pieces
excellent judgment, I compare with perfect im-
partiality one great man with another, and each with
the rule of juſtice. If indeed later ages have pro-
duced greater men and better writers, my heroes
and my works ought to give place to them. As the
world has now the aſſiſtance of much better rules of
morality, than the unaffifted reaſon of poor Pagans
could form, I do not wonder that thoſe vices, which
appeared to us as mere blemiſhes in great characters,
ſhould ſeem moft horrid deformities in the purer eyes
of the preſent age. A delicacy I do not blame, but
admire and commend ; and I muſt cenſure you for
endeavouring, if you could publiſh better examples,
to obtrude on your countrymen ſuch as were de-
fective. I rejoice at the preference which they gave
to

to perfect and unallayed virtue ; and as I ſhall ever
retain an high veneration for the illuſtrious men of
every age, I ſhould be glad you would give me ſome
account of thoſe perſons, who in wiſdom, juſtice,
valour, patriotiſm, have eclipſed my Solon, Numa,
Camillus, Scipio, &c.
Bookfeller. Why, Maſter Plutarch, you are talking
Greek"indeed. That work which repaired the loſs
I ſuſtained by the coſtly edition of your books, was,
The Lives of the Highwaymen: but I ſhould never
have grown rich, if it had not been by publiſhing
the lives of men that never lived. You muſt know,
that though in all times it was poſſible to have a great
deal of learning and very little wiſdom, yet it is only
by a modern improvement in the art of writing,
that a man may read all his life and have no learn-
ing or knowledge at all, which begins to be an ad-
vantage of the greatest importance. There is as
natural a war between your inen of ſcience and fools,
as between the cranes and the pigmnies of old. Moſt
of our young men having deſerted to the fools, the
party of the learned is near being beaten out of the
field; and I hope in a little while they will not dare
to peep out of their forts and faſtneſſes at Oxford and
Cambridge. There let them ſtay and ſtudy old
multy moraliſts, till one falls in love with the Greek,
another with the Roman virtue; but our men of
the world ſhould read our new books, which teach
them to have no virtue at all. No book is fit for a
gentleman's reading which is not void of facts and of
doctrines, that he may not grow a pedant in his mo-
rals or converſation. I look upon hiſtory. (I mean
real hiſtory) to be one of the worſt kinds of ſtudy.
Whatever has happened may happen again; and a
well-bred man may unwarily mention a parallel in-
ſtance he had met with in hiſtory, and he betrayed
into the awkwardneſs of introducing into his diſcourſe
a Greek, Roman, or even Gothic name. But
when a gentleman has ſpent his time in reading ad-
ventures that never occurred, exploits that never
were atchieved, and events that not only never did,
but

157
but nerer can happen, it is impoſſible that in lite
or in diſcourſe he ſhould ever apply them. A fecret
hiſtory, in which there is no ſecret and no hiſtory,
cannot tempt indiſcretion to blab or vanity to quote;
and by this means modern converſation flows gentle
and ealy, unincumbered with matter, and unburthen-
ed of inſtruction. As the preſent ſtudies throw no
weight or gravity into diſcourſe and manners, the
women are not afraid to read our books, which not
only diſpoſe to gallantry and coquetry, but give
rules for them. Cæſar's Commentaries, and the ac-
count of Xenophon's expedition, are not more ſtudied
by military commanders, than our novels are by the
fair: to a different purpoſe indeed : for their mili-
tary maxims teach to conquer, ours to yield: thoſe
inflame the vain and idle love of glory, theſe incul-
cate a noble contempt of reputation. The women
have greater obligations to our writers than the men.
By the commerce of the world men might learivmuch
of what they get from books; but the poor women,
who, in their early youth, are confined and reſtrained,
if it were not for the friendly alliſtance of books,
would remain long in an infipid purity of mind,
with a diſcouraging reſerve of behaviour.
Plutarch. As to your men who have quitted the
ſtudy of virtue for the ſtudy of vice, uſeful truth
for abfurd fancy, and real hiſtory for monſtrous fic-
tion, I have neither regard nor compaſſion for them :
but I am concerned for the women who are betrayed
into theſe dangerous ſtudies : and I wiſh, for their
fakes, I had expatiated more on the character of
Lucretia and ſome other heroines.
Bookſeller. I tell you our women do not read in
order to live or to die like Lucretia. If you would
inform us that a billet doux was found in her cabi-
net after her death, or give an hint as if Tarquin
really ſaw her in the arms of a ſlave, and that ſhe
killed herſelf to prevent a diſcovery, ſuch anecdotes
would fell very well. Or if even by tradition, but
better ſtill if by papers in the Portian family, you
would ſhew ſome probability that Portia died of
dram-

dram-drinking, you would oblige the world very
much; for you muſt know that, next to new-invent-
ed characters, we are fond of new lights upon ancient
characters ; I mean ſuch lights as Thew a reputed
honeſt man to have been a concealed knave; an il.
luſtrious hero a pitiful coward, &c. Nay, we are
fo fond of theſe kinds of information, as to be pleaſed
ſometiines to ſee a character cleared from a vice or
crime it has been charged with, provided the perſon
concerned be actually dead. But in this caſe the
evidence muſt be authentic, and amount to a demon-
ftration : in the other, a detection is not neceſſary ;
a flight fufpicion will do, if it concerns a really good
and great character.
Plutarch. I ain the more ſurpriſed at what you
fay of the taſte of your contemporaries, as I met
with a Frenchman who aſſured me that lefs than a
century ago he had written a much-admired life of
Cyrus, under the name of Artamenes, in which he
aſcribed to him far greater actions than thoſe re-
corded of him by Xenophon and Herodotus, and
that many of the great heroes of hiſtory had been
treated in the ſame manner; that empires were gain-
ed and battles decided by the valour of a ſingle man,
imagination beſtowing what nature has denied, and
the ſyſtem of human affairs rendered impoſſible.
Bookſeller. I aſſure you theſe books were very
uſeful
to authors and their bookſellers; and for whoſe
benefit belide ſhould a man write? theſe romances were
very faſhionable, and had a great fale; they fell in
luckily with the humour of the age.
Plutarch. Monſieur Scuderi tells me they were
written in the times of vigour and ſpirit, in the
evening of the gallant days of chivalry, which,
though then declining, had left in the hearts of men
a warm glow of courage and heroiſm; and they were
to be called to books, as to battle, by the found of
the trumpet. He ſays too that, if writers had not
accommodated themſelves to the prejudices of the
age, and written of bloody battles and deſperate en-
counters, their works would have been eſteemed too
effeminate

159
effeminate an amuſement for gentlemen. Hiſtories
of chivalry, inſtead of enervating, tend to invigorate
the mind, and endeavour to raiſe humanity above
the condition which is naturally preſcribed to it;
but as ſtrict juſtice, patriot motives, prudent 'coun-
fels, and a diſpaſſionate choice of what, upon the
whole, is the fitteſt and beſt, do not direct theſe he-
roes of romance, they cannot ſerve for inſtruction
and example, like the great characters of true hiſtory.
It has ever been my opinion, that only the clear
and ſteady light of truth can guide men to virtue,
and that the leſſon which is impracticable muſt be
unuſeful. Whoever ſhall deſign to regulate his con-
duct by theſe viſionary characters, will be in the con-
dition of ſuperſtitious people, who chooſe rather to
act by intimations they receive in the dreams of the
night, than by the fober counſels of morning medi-
tation. Yet 'I confeſs it has been the practice of
many nations to incite men to virtue by relating the
deeds of fabulous heroes; but ſurely it is the cuſtom
only of yours to incite them to vice by the hiſtory
of fabulous ſcoundrels. Men of fine imagination
have ſoared into the regions of fancy to bring back
Aſtrea: you go thither in ſearch of Pandora: oh dif-
grace to letters ! oh ſhame to the muſes!
Bookſeller. You expreſs great indignation at our
preſent race of writers; but, believe me, the fault
lies chiefly on the ſide of the readers. As Monſieur
Scuderi obſerved to you, authors muſt comply with
the manners and diſpoſition of thoſe who are to read
them. There muſt be a certain ſympathy between
the book and the reader, to create a good liking.
Would you preſent a modern fine gentleman, who is
negligently lolling in an eaſy chair, with the labours
of Hercules for his recreation? Or make him climb
the Alps with Hannibal, when he is expiring with
the fatigue of laſt night's ball ? Our readers muſt be
amuſed, fattered, ſoothed; ſuch adventures muſt be
offered to them as they would like to have a ſhare in.
Plutarch. It ſhould be the firſt object of writers
to correct the vices and follies of the
age.

allow as much compliance with the mode of the
times as will make truth and good morals agreeable.
Your love of fictitious characters might be turned to
good purpoſe, if thoſe preſented to the public were
to be formed on the rules of religion and morality.
It muſt be confeſſed that hiſtory, being employed
only about illuſtrious perſons, public events, and cele-
brated actions, does not ſupply us with ſuch inſtances
of domeſtic merit as one could wiſh: our heroes are
great in the field and the ſenate, and act well in
great ſcenes on the theatre of the world: but the
idea of a man, who, in the filent retired path of life
never deviates into vice, who conſiders no fpectator
but the Omniſcient Being, and ſolicits no applauſe
but his approbation, is the nobleſt model that can
be exhibited to mankind, and would be of the moſt
general uſe. Examples of domeſtic virtue would be
more particularly uſeful to women than thoſe of
great heroines. The virtues of women are blaſted
by the breath of public fame, as flowers that grow
on an eminence are faded by the ſun and wind which
expand them. But true female praiſe, like the mufic
of the ſpheres, ariſes from a gentle, a conſtant, and
an equal progreſs in the path marked out for them
by their great Creator; and, like the heavenly har-
mony, it is not adapted to the groſs ear of mortals,
but is reſerved for the delight of higher beings, by
whoſe wiſe laws they were ordained to give a ſilent
light, and ſhed a mild benignant influence on the
world.
Bookſeller. We have had ſome Engliſh and French
writers who aimed at what you ſuggeſt. In the ſup-
poſed character of Clariſſa (ſaid a clergy man to me
a few days Lefore I left the world) one finds the
dignity of heroiſm tempered by the meekneſs and
humility of religion, a perfect purity of mind and
ſanctity of manners. In that of Sir Charles Grandi-
fon, a noble pattern of every private virtue, with
ſentiments ſo exalted as to render him equal to every
public duty

Plutarch. Are both theſe characters by the fame

Bookſeller. Aye, Maſter Plutarch, and what will
ſurpriſe you more, this author has printed for me.
Plutarch. By what you ſay it is pity he ſhould
print any works but his own. Are there no other
authors who write in this manner ?
Bookſeller. Yes, we have another writer of theſe
imaginary hiſtories ; one who has not long ſince de-
fcended to theſe regions; his name is Fielding, and
his works, as I have heard the beſt judges ſay, have
a true ſpirit of comedy, and an exact repreſentation
of nature, with fine moral touches. He has not in-
deed given leſſons of pure and conſummate virtue, but
he has expoſed vice and meanneſs with all the powers
of ridicule; and we have ſome other good wits, who
have exerted their talents to the purpoſes you ap-
prove. Monſieur de Marivaux and foine other French
writers have alſo proceeded much upon the fame
plan, with a fpirit and elegance which give their
works no mean rank among the belles lettres. I will
own that, when there is wit and elegance enough
in a book to make it ſell, it is not the worſe for good
morals.
Charon. I think, Plutarch, you have made this
gentleman a little more humble, and now I will
carry him the reſt of his journey; but he is too fri-
volous an animal to preſent to wife Minos. I wiſh
Mercury were here, he would damn him for his
dulneſs. I have a good mind to carry him to the
D.inaïdes, and leave him to pour water into their
veſſels, which, like his late readers, are deſtined to
eternal emptineſs. Or ſhall I chain him to the rock,
ſide to ſide by Prometheus, not for having attempt-
ed to ſteal celeſtial fire, in order to animate human
forms, but for having endeavoured to extinguiſh that
which Jupiter had imparted ? Or ſhall we constitute
him friſeur to Tiliphone, and make him curl up her
locks with his fatires and libels?

been ſufficient to have ended them both. The occa-
fion of this ſeems to be the want of ſome neceffary
einployment to put the ſpirits in motion, and awaken
them out of their lethargy. If I had leſs leiſure I

diſtinguiſhed into portions, fome for buſineſs, and

Inſtead of hurrying away to teaze a poor animal

run away from their own thoughts, à chair or a cha-

performing a remove from one place to another. I

half ſo uſeful in phyſic as I ſhould be to thoſe feveriſh
conſtitutions, to repreſs the violent fallies of youth,
and give each action its proper weight and repoſe.
I can ſtifle any violent inclination, and oppoſe a
torrent of anger, or the ſolicitations of revenge,
with ſucceſs. But indolence is a ſtream which flows
ſlowly on, but yet undermines the foundation of
every virtue. A vice of a more lively nature were a
more deſirable tyrant than this ruſt of the mind,
which gives a tincture of its nature to every
action
of one's life. It were as little hazard to be toſt in a
ſtorm, as to lie thus perpetually becalmed; and it
is to no purpoſe to have within one the ſeeds of a
thouſand good qualities, if we want the vigour and

The time we live ought not to be computed by

the yearly rent which gives the value to the eſtate.

ſtanding this, the greateſt wits any age has produced
thought far otherwiſe ; for who can think either So-
crates or Demoſthenes loſt any reputation by their
continual pains both in overcoming the defects and
improving the gifts of nature. All are acquainted
with the labour and aſſiduity with which Tully ac-
quired his eloquence. Seneca, in his letters to Lu-
cellius, affures hin there was not a day in which he
did not either write ſomething, or read and epito-
mize ſome good author: and I remember Pliny in
one of his letters, where he gives an account of the
various methods he uſed to fill up every vacancy of
time, after ſeveral employinents which he enume-
rates, “Sometimes,” ſays he, “I hunt; but even then
“ I carry with me a pocket-book, that, whilft my

faith Seneca, and yet have much more than
we know what to do with. Our lives, ſays he, are
fpent either in doing nothing at all, or in doing no-
thing to the purpoſe, or in doing nothing that we
ought to do: we are always complaining our days
are few, and acting as though there would be no
end of them. That noble philoſopher has deſcribed
our inconſiſtency with ourſelves in this particular, by
all thoſe various turns of expreſſion and thought
which are peculiar to his writings.
I often conſider mankind as wholly inconſiſtent
with itſelf in a point that bears ſome affinity to the
former. Though we ſeem grieved at the ſhortneſs
of life, in general, we are wiſhing every period of it
at an end.
The minor longs to be at age, then to
be a man of buſineſs, then to make up an eitate, then
to arrive at honours, then to retire. Thus although

nay, we wiſh away whole years, and travel through
time as through a country filled with many wild and
empty waites, which we would fain hurry over, that
we may arrive at thoſe ſeveral little ſettlements or
imaginary points of reſt which are diſperſed up and
down in it.
If we divide the life of moſt men into twenty parts,
we ſhall find that at leaſt nineteen of them are mere
gaps and chaſms, which are neither filled with plea-
ſure nor buſineſs. I do not, however, include in this
calculation the life of thoſe men who are in a perpe-
tual hurry of affairs, but of thoſe only who are not
always engaged in ſcenes of action ; and I hope I
Mall not do an unacceptable piece of ſervice to thoſe
perſons, if I point out to them certain methods for
the filling up their empty ſpaces of life. The me-
thods I ſhall propoſe to them are as follow :
The firſt is the exercite of virtue, in the moſt gene-
ral acceptation of the word. That particular ſcheme,
which comprehends the focial virtues, may give em-
ployment to the moſt induſtrious temper, and find a
man buſineſs more than the moſt active ſtation of life.
To adviſe the ignorant, relieve the needy, comfort
the afflicted, are duties that fall in our way almoſt
every day of our lives.
A man has frequent oppor.
tunities of mitigating the fierceneſs of a party; of
doing juſtice to the character of a deſerving man ;
of ſoftening the envious, quieting the angry, and
rectifying

rectifying the prejudiced; which are all of them
employments fuited to a reaſonable nature, and bring
great fatisfaction to the perſon who can buſy himlelf
in them with difcretion.
There is another kind of virtue that may find em-
ployment for thoſe retired hours in which we are
altogether left to ourſelves, and deſtitute of compa-
ny and converſation; I mean that intercourſe and
communication which
every reaſonable creature ought
to maintain with the great Author of his being.
The man who lives under an habitual ſenſe of the
Divine Preſence keeps up a perpetual cheerfulneſs
of temper, and enjoys every moment the ſatisfaction
of thinking himſelf in company with his deareſt and
beſt of friends. The time never lies heavy upon
himn; it is impoſſible for him to be alone. His
thoughts and paſſions are the moſt buſied at ſuch
hours when thoſe of other men are the moſt unactive.
He no fooner ſteps out of the world, but his heart
burns with devotion, ſwells with hope, and triumphs
in the conſciouſneſs of that preſence which every
where ſurrounds him; or, on the contrary, pours
out its fears, its forrows, its apprehenſions to the
great Supporter of its exiſtence.
I have here only contidered the neceſſity of a
man's being virtuous, that he may have ſomething
to do; but if we conſider further, that the exercife
of virtue is not only an amuſement for the time it
lasts, but that its influence extends to thoſe parts of
our exiſtence which lie beyond the grave, and that
our whole eternity is to take its colour from thoſe
hours which we here employ in virtue or in vice,
the argument redoubles upon us, for putting in prac.
tice this method of paling away our time.
When a man has but a little ſtock to improve, and
has opportunities of turning it all to good account,
what ſhall we think of him if he ſuffers nineteen
parts of it to lie dead, and perhaps employs even the
twentieth to his ruin or diſadvantage ? but becauſe
the mind cannot be always in its fervors, por llrained

up to a pitch of virtue, it is neceſſary to find out
proper employınents for it in its relaxations.
The next method, therefore, that I would propoſe
to fill up our time, ſhould be uſeful and innocent
diverſions. I muſt confeſs I think it is below rea-
fonable creatures to be altogether converſant in ſuch
diverſions as are merely innocent, and have nothing
elſe to recommend them, but there is no hurt in
them. Whether any kind of gaming has even thus
much to ſay for itſelf I ſhall not determine; but I
think it is very wonderful to ſee perſons of the beſt
ſenſe paſſing away a dozen hours together in fhuffling
and dividing a pack of cards, with no other conver-
ſation but what is inade up of a few game phraſes,
and no other ideas but thoſe of black or red ſpots
ranged together in different figures. Would not a
man laugh to hear any one of this ſpecies complain-
ing that life is ſhort ?
The ſtage might be made a perpetual ſource of the
moſt noble and uſeful entertainments, were it under
proper regulations. But the mind never unbends
itſelf ſo agreeably as in the converſation of a well-
choſen friend : there is indeed no bleſſing of life that
is any way comparable to the enjoyment of a dif-
creet and virtuous friend: it eaſes and unload; the
mind, clears and improves the underſtanding, engen-
ders thought and knowledge, animates virtue and
good reſolutions, foothes and allays the paſſions,
and finds employment for moſt of the vacant hours
of life.
Next to ſuch an intimacy with a particular perſon,
one would endeavour after a more general converſa-
tion with ſuch as are capable of edifying and enter-
taining thoſe with whom they converſe, which are
qualities that ſeldom go afunder.
There are many other uſeful amuſements of life,
which one would endeavour to multiply, that one
might on all occaſions, have recourſe to ſomething
rather than ſuffer the mind to lie idle, or run adrift
with any paſſion that chances to riſe in it. A man

that has a taſte in muſic, painting, or architecture, is
like one that has another ſenſe, when compared with
ſuch as have no reliſh of thoſe arts. The floriſt, the
planter, the gardener, the huſbandman, when they
are only as accompliſhments to the man of fortune,
are great reliefs to a country life, and many ways uſe-
ful to thoſe who are poſſeſſed of them.

The Practice of Virtue recommended.
[From the famc.]
WH
THEN Hercules, ſays the divine Prodicus,
was in that part of his youth in which it
was natural for him to conſider what courſe of life he
ought to purſue, he one day retired into a deſert,
where the ſilence and ſolitude of the place very much
favoured his meditations. As he was muſing on his
preſent condition, very much perplexed in himſelf
on the ſtate of life he ſhould chooſe, he ſaw two wo-
men, of a larger ſtature than ordinary, approaching
towards him. One of them had a very notable air
and graceful deportment; her beauty was natural
and eaſy; her perſon, clean and unſported; her eyes
caſt towards the ground with an agreeable reſerve ;
her motion and behaviour full of modeſty; and her
raiment white as ſnow. The other had a great deal
of health and floridneſs in her countenance, which
ſhe had helped with an artificial white and red, and
endeavoured to appear more graceful than ordinary
in her mien, by a mixture of affectation in all her
geitures. She had a wonderful confidence and aflu-
rance in her looks, and all the variety of colours in
her dreſs that ſhe thought were the moſt proper to
Thew her complexion to an advantage. She cait her
eyes upon herſelf, then turned them on thoſe that
were preſent to ſee how they liked her, and often
looked on the figure ſhe made in her own ſhadow.
Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, The ſtepped

regular compoſed carriage) and running up to him,
accoſted him after the following manner :
My dear Hercules, ſays ſhe, I find you are very
much divided in your own thoughts upon
the
way
of
life that you ought to chooſe: be my friend, and fol-
low me; I will lead you into the poſſeſſion of plea-
fure, and out of the reach of pain, and remove you
from all the noiſe and diſquietude of buſineſs. The
affairs of either war or peace ſhall have no power to
diſturb you : your whole employment ſhall be to
make your life eaſy, and to entertain every ſenſe
with its proper gratifications. Sumptuous tables,
beds of roſes, clouds of perfumes, concerts of muſic,
crowds of beauties, are all in readineſs to receive you.
Come along with me into this region of delights,
this world of pleaſure, and bid farewell for ever to
care, to pain, to buſineſs.
Hercules, hearing the lady talk after this manner,
deſired to know her name; to which ſhe anſwered,
My friends, and thoſe who are well acquainted with
me, call me Happineſs ; but my enemies, and thoſe
who would injure my reputation, have given me the
name of Pleaſure.
By this time the other lady was come up, who ad-
dreſſed herſelf to the young hero in a very different
manner
Hercules, ſays ſhe, I offer myfelf to you, becauſe I
know you are deſcended from the gods, and give
proofs of that deſcent by your love to virtue, and ap-
plication to the ſtudies proper for your age. This
makes me hope you will gain both for yourſelf and
ene an immortal reputation. But, before I invite
you into my ſociety and friendſhip, I will be open
and ſincere with you, and muſt lay down this as an
eſtabliſhed truth, that there is nothing truly valuable
which can be purchaſed without pains and labour.
The gods have ſet a price upon every real and noble
pleaſure ; if you would gain the favour of the Deity,
you muſt be at the pains of worſhipping him; if the
friendſhip of good men, you muſt ſtudy to oblige
them;

then; if you would be honoured by your country, you
muſt take care to ſerve it. In ſhort, if you would be
eminent in war or peace, you muſt become maſter of
all the qualifications that can make you ſo: Theſe
are the only terms and conditions upon which I can
propoſe happineſs. The goddeſs of pleaſure here
broke in upon her diſcourſe: You ſee, taid ſhe, Her-
cules, by her own confeſſion, the way to her pleaſure
is long and difficult, whereas that which I propoſe is
Thort and eaſy. Alas! ſaid the other lady, whoſe
viſage glowed with a paſſion made up of ſcorn and
pity, what are the pleaſures you propoſe? To eat
before you are hungry, drink before you are thirſty,
fleep before you are tired, to gratify appetites before
they are raiſed, and raiſe ſuch appetites as nature
never planted. You never heard the moſt delicious
muſic which is the praiſe of one's ſelf; nor ſaw the
moſt beautiful object, which is the work of one's own
hands. Your votaries paſs away their youth in a
dream of miſtaken pleaſures, while they are hoarding
up anguiſh, torinent, and remorſe for old age.
As for ine, I am the friend of gods and of good
men, an agreeable companion to the artizan, a houſe-
hold.guardian to the fatbers of families, a patron and
protector of ſervants, an aſſociate in all true and gene-
rous friendſhips. The banquets of my votaries are
never coſtly, but always delicious; for none eat of
drink at them who are not invited by hunger and
thirſt. Their flumbers are found, and their wakings
cheerful. My young men have the pleaſure of
hearing themſelves praiſed by thoſe who are in years
aud thoſe who are in years, of being honoured by
thoſe who are young.
In a word, my followers are
favoured by the gods, beloved by their acquaintance,
eſteemed by their
country, and (after the cloſe of their
labours) honoured by poſterity.
We know by the life of this memorable hero, to
which of thoſe two ladies he gave up his heart; and
I believe every one who reads this will do hin the
juſtice to approve his choice.

I very much admire the ſpeeches of theſe ladies,
as containing in them the chief arguments for a life
of virtue, or a life of pleaſure, -that could enter into
the thoughts of an Heathen : but am particularly
pleaſed with the different figures he gives the two
goddeſſes. Our modern authors have repreſented
Pleaſure or Vice with an alluring face, but ending
in ſnakes and monſters : here ſhe appears in all the
charms of beauty, though they were all falſe and
borrowed, and by that means compoſes a viſion en-
tirely natural and pleaſing.
I have tranſlated this allegory for the benefit of the
youth of Great Britain; and particularly of thoſe
who are ſtill in the deplorable ſtate of non-exiſtence,
and whom I moſt earneſtly entreat to come into the
world. Let my embryos ſhew the leaſt inclination
to any ſingle virtue, and I ſhall allow it to be a ſtrug,
gling towards birth. I do not expect of them that,
like the hero in the foregoing ſtory, they ſhould go
about as ſoon as they are born, with a club in their
hands and a lion's ſkin on their ſhoulders, to root out
monſters and deſtroy tyrants; but, as the fineſt au-
thor of all antiquity has ſaid upon this very occaſion,
though a man has not the abilities to diſtinguiſh him-
ſelf in the moſt ſhining parts of a great character,
he has certainly the capacity of being juſt, faithful,
modeft, and temperate.

in the world for a man to ſeem to be any thing, is
really to be what he would ſeem to be. Beſides that,
it is many times as troubleſome to make good the
pretence of a good quality as to have it ; and if a
man has it not, it is ten to one but he is diſcovered
to want it, and then all his pains and labour to feem
to have it is loſt. There is ſomething unnatural in
painting, which a ſkilful eye will eaſily diſcern from
native beauty and complexion.
It is hard to perſonate and act a part long; for
where truth is not at the bottom, nature will always
be endeavouring to return, and will peep out and be-
tray herſelf one time of other. Therefore if any
man thinks it convenient to feem good, let him be
fo indeed, and then his goodneſs will appear to every
body's ſatisfaction; ſo that, upon all accounts, ſince-
rity is true wiſdom. Particularly as to the affairs of
this world, integrity hath many advantages over all
the fine and artificial ways of diffimulation and deceit;
it is much the plainer and eafier, much the ſafer and
more ſecure way of dealing in the world; it has leſs
of trouble and difficulty, of entanglement and per-
plexity, of danger and hazard in it; it is the ſhorteſt
and neareſt way to our end, carrying us thither in a
ſtraight line, and will hold out and laſt longeſt. The
arts of deceit and cunning do continually grow weaker,
and leſs effectual and ſerviceable to them that uſe
them; whereas integrity gains ſtrength by uſe, and
the more and longer any man practiſeth it, the greater
ſervice it does hin, by confirming his reputation,
and encouraging thoſe with whom he hath to do to
repoſe the greateſt truſt and confidence in him, which
is an unſpeakable advantage in the buſineſs and affairs
of life.
Truth is always conſiſtent with itſelf, and needs
nothing to help it out ; it is always near at hand, and
fits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we
are aware; whereas a lie is troubleſome, and ſets a
man's invention upon the rack, and one trick needs a
great many more to make it good. It is like building
upon a falſe foundation, which continually ſtands in
need

need of props to ſhore it up, and proves at laſt more
chargeable than to have raiſed a ſubſtantial building
at firſt upon a true and ſolid foundation ; for fincerity
is firm and ſubſtantial, and there is nothing hollow
and unfound in it; and becauſe it is plain and open
fears no diſcovery; of which the crafty man is always
in danger, and when he thinks he walks in the dark,
all his pretences are ſo tranſparent that he that runs
may read thein : he is the laſt man that finds himſelf
to be found out; and while he takes it for granted
that he makes fools of others, he renders himſelf ri-
diculous.
Add to all this, that ſincerity is the moft compen-
dious wiſdom, and an excellent inſtrument for the
ſpeedy diſpatch of buſineſs; it creates confidence in
thoſe we have to deal with, faves the labour of many
inquiries, and brings things to an iſſue in few words":
it is like travelling in a plain beaten road, which
commonly brings a man ſooner to his journey's end
than bye-ways, in which men often loſe themſelves.
In a word, whatſoever convenience may be thought
to be in falſehood and diſſimulation, it is ſoon over ;
but the inconvenience of it is perpetual, becauſe it
brings a man under an everlaſting jealouſy and ſuf-
picion, ſo that he is not believed when he ſpeaks
truth, nor truſted when perhaps he means honeſtly.
When a man hath once forfeited the reputation of
his integrity, he is ſet faſt, and nothing will then
ſerve his turn, neither truth nor falſehood.
And I have often thought that God hath, in his
great wiſdom, hid from men of falſe and diſhoneft
minds the wonderful advantages of truth and integrity
to the prosperity even of our worldly affairs ; theſe
men are ſo blinded by their covetouſneſs and ambi-
tion, that they cannot look beyond a preſent advan-
tage, nor forbear to ſeize upon it, though by ways
ever ſo indirect: they cannot ſee ſo far as to the re-
moteſt conſequences of a ſteady integrity, and the
vaſt benefit and advantages which it will bring a man

out of very knavery; not out of any love to honeſty,
and virtue, but with a crafty deſign to promote and
advance more effectually their own intereſts; and
therefore the juſtice of the Divine Providence hath
hid this trueſt point of wifdoin from their eyes, that
bad men might not be upon equal terins with the
juſt and upright, and ferve their own wicked deſigns-
by honeſt and lawful means.
Indeed, if a man were only to deal in the world
for a day, and ſhould never have occafion to converſe
more with mankind, never more need their good
opinion or good word, it were then no great matter
(ſpeaking as to the concernments of this world) if a
man ſpent his reputation all at once, and ventured
it at one throw : but if he be to continue in the
world, and would have the advantage of converſa-
tion whilſt he is in it, let him make uſe of truth and
ſincerity in all his words and actions ; for nothing
but this will laſt and hold out to the end: all other
arts will fail, but truth and integrity will carry a
man through, and bear him out to the laſt.

« ill of.” Little minds think fame conſiſts in the
number of votes they have on their ſide among the
multitude, whereas it is really the infeparable fol-
lower of good and worthy actions. Fame is as natu-
ral a follower of merit, as a ſhadow is of a body. It
is true, when crowds preſs upon you, this ſhadow
cannot be ſeen; but when they ſeparate from around
you it will again appear. The lazy, the idle, and
the froward, are the perſons who are the moſt pleaſed
with the little tales which paſs about the town to the
diſadvantage of the reſt of the world. Were it not
for the pleaſure of ſpeaking ill, there are numbers of
people who are too lazy to go out of their own
houſes, and too ill-natured to open their lips in con-
verſation. It was not a little diverting the other day
to obſerve a lady reading a poſt letter, and at theſe
words, “ After all her airs he has heard fome ſtory
or other, and the match is broke off,” give orders,
in the midſt of her reading, “ Put to the horſes."
That a young woman of merit had miſſed an advan,
tageous ſettlement was news not to be delayed, left
ſomebody elſe ſhould have given her malicious ac-
quaintance that ſatisfaction before her. The un-
willingneſs to receive good tidings is a quality as in-
ſeparable from a ſcandal-bearer, as the readineſs to
divulge bad. But, alas ! how wretchedly low and
contemptible is that ſtate of mind, that cannot be
pleaſed but by what is the ſubject of lamentation.
This temper has ever been in the higheſt degree odious
to gallant fpirits. The Perfian ſoldier, who was
heard reviling Alexander the Great, was well ad.
moniſhed by his officer; “Sir, you are paid to fight
“ againſt Alexander, and not to rail at him.”
Cicero in one of his pleadings, defending his client

ſuch as the orator has here recited: and how defpi-
cable a creature muſt that be, who is in pain for
what paſſes among ſo frivolous a people? There is
a town in Warwickſhire of good note, and formerly
pretty famous for much animoſity and diffention, the
chief families of which have now turned all their
whiſpers, backbitings, envies, and private malices
into mirth and entertainment, by means of a peeviſh
old gentlewoman, known by the title of the Lady Blue-
mantle. This heroine had for many years together out-
done the whole fifterhood of goffips in invention, quick
utterance, and unprovoked malice. This good body
is of a laſting conſtitution, though extremely decayed
in her eyes, and decrepit in her feet. The two
circumſtances of being always at home from her
lameneſs, and very attentive from her blindneſs,
make her lodgings the receptacle of all that paſſes
in town, good or bad ; but for the latter the feenis
to have the better memory. There is another thing
to be noted of her, which is, that, as it is uſual with
old people, ſhe has a livelier memory of things
which paſſed when ſhe was very young than of late
years. Add to all this, that ſhe does not only not
love any body, but ſhe hates every body. The ſtatue
in Rome does not ſerve to vent malice, half ſo well
as this old lady does to diſappoint it. She does not
know the author of any thing that is told her, but

Whoever receives impreffions to the diſadvantage

On Cheerfulneſs.
[From the fame.]
I
HAVE always preferred cheerfulneſs to mirth.
The latter I conſider as an act, the former as an
habit of the mind. Mirth is ſhort and tranſient,
Cheerfulneſs fixed and permanent. Thoſe are often
raiſed into the greateſt tranſports of mirth, who are
ſubject to the greateſt depreſſions of melancholy. On
the contrary, Cheerfulneſs, though it does not give
the mind ſuch an exquiſite gladneſs, prevents us
from falling into any depths of ſorrow. Mirth is
like a flaſh of lightening, that breaks through a gloom
of clouds, and glitters for a moment : Cheerfulneſs
keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind, and fills it
with a ſteady and perpetual ſerenity.
Men of auſtere principles look upon mirth as too
wanton and diffolute for a ſtate of probation, and as
filled with a certain triumph and infolence of heart,
that is inconſiſtent with a life that is every moment
obnoxious to the greateſt dangers. Writers of this
complexion have obſerved, that the ſacred perſon
who was the great pattern of perfection was never ſeen
to laugh.
Cheerfulneſs of mind is not liable to any of theſe
exceptions; it is of a ſerious and compoſed nature ;
it does not throw the mind into a condition improper
for the preſent ſtate of humanity, and is very conſpi-
cuous in the characters of thoſe who are looked upon
as the greateſt philoſophers among the Heathens, as
well as among thoſe who have been deſervedly eſteem-
ed as faints and holy men among Chriſtians.
If we conſider Cheerfulneſs in three lights, with
regard to ourſelves, to thoſe we converte with, and
to the great Author of our being, it will not a little.

gination is always clear, and his judgment undifturb-

aétion or in folitude. He comes with a reliſh to all
thoſe goods which nature has provided for him, taſtes
all the pleaſures of the creation which are poured
about him, and does not feel the full weight of thoſe
accidental evils which may befal him.
If we conſider him in relation to the perfons whom
he converſes with, it naturally produces love and
goodwill towards him. A cheerful mind is not only
diſpoſed to be affable and obliging, but raiſes the
fame good humour in thoſe who come within its in-
fluence. A man finds himſelf pleaſed, he does not
know why, with the cheerfulneſs of his companion ;
it is like a ſudden ſunſhine that awakens a ſecret de-
light in the mind without attending to it. The heart
rejoices of its own accord, and naturally flows out
into friendſhip and benevolence towards the perſon
who has ſo kindly an effect upon
When I conſider this cheerful ſtate of mind in its
third relation, I cannot but look upon it as a conſtant
habitual gratitude to the great Author of nature. An
inward Cheerfulneſs is an implicit praiſe and thankſ-
giving to Providence under all his diſpenſations. It
is a kind of acquieſcence in the ſtate wherein we are
placed, and a ſecret approbation of the Divine Will
in his conduct towards man.
There are but two things which, in my opinion,
can reaſonably deprive us of this Cheerfulneſs of
heart. The firſt of theſe is the ſenſe of guilt. A
man who lives in a ſtate of vice and impenitence, can
have no title to that evenneſs and tranquillity of mind
which is the health of the foul, and the natural effect
of virtue and innocence. Cheerfulneſs in an ill man
deſerves a harder name than language can furniſh us
with, and is many degrees beyond what we commonly
call folly and madneſs.
Atheiſm, by which I mean a diſbelief of the Su.
preme Being, and conſequently of a future ſtate,
under whatſoever titles it ſhelters itſelf, may likewiſe
very reaſonably deprive as man of this Cheerfulneſs

of temper.
There is ſomething fo particularly
gloomy and offenſive to human nature in the proſpect
of non-exiſtence, that I cannot but wonder, with
many excellent writers, how it is poſſible for a man
to outlive the expectation of it. For my own part,
I think the being of a God is ſo little to be doubted,
that it is almoſt the only truth we are ſure of : and
ſuch a truth as we meet with in every object, in every
occurrence, and in every thought. If we look into
the characters of this tribe of infidels, we generally
find they are made up of pride, ſpleen, and cavil:
it is indeed no wonder that men, who are uneaſy to
themſelves, ſhould be fo to the reſt of the world ;
and how is it poſſible for a man to be otherwiſe than
uneaſy in himſelf, who is in danger every moment
of loſing his entire exiſtence, and dropping into no-
thing?
The vicious man and atheiſt have, therefore, no
pretence to Cheerfulneſs, and would act very unrea-
ſonably ſhould they endeavour after it. It is im-
poffible for any one to live in good humour, and
enjoy his preſent exiſtence, who is apprehenſive
either of torment or of annihilation; of being miſe-
rable, or of not being at all.
After having mentioned theſe two great principles,
which are deſtructive of Cheerfulneſs in their own
nature as well as in right refon, I cannot think of
any other that ought to baniſh this happy temper
from a virtuous mind. Pain and ſickneſs, ſhaine and
reproach, poverty and old age, nay death itſelf, con-
fidering the ſhortneſs of their duration, and the ad-
vantage we may reap from them, do not deſerve the
name of evils. A good mind may bear up under
them with fortitude, with indolence, and with Cheer-
fulneſs of heart. The toiling of a tempeft does not
diſcompoſe him, which he is fure will bring him to a
joyful harbour.
A man who uſes his beſt endeavours to live accord-
ing to the dictates of virtue and right reaſon, has two
perpetual ſources of Cheerfulneſs; in the conſidera-
tion of his own nature, and of that Being on whom
he

he has a dependence. If he looks into himſelf, he
cannot but rejoice in that exiſtence which is fo lately
beſtowed upon him, and which, after_millions of
ages, will be ſtill new, and ſtill in its beginning.
How many ſelf-congratulations naturally ariſe in the
mind, when it reflects on this its entrance into eter-
nity, when it takes a view of thoſe improveable
faculties, which in a few years, and even at its firſt
ſetting out, have made ſo conſiderable a progreſs,
and which will be ſtill receiving an increaſe of per-
fection, and conſequently an increaſe of happineſs?
The conſciouſneſs of ſuch a being ſpreads a perpetual
diffuſion of joy through the ſoul of a virtuous man,
and makes him look upon himſelf every moment as
more happy than he knows how to conceive.
The ſecond ſource of Cheerfulneſs to a good
mind, is its conſideration of that Being on whom we
have our dependence, and in whom, though we be-
hold him as yet but in the firſt faint diſcoveries of
his perfections, we ſee every thing that we can ima-
gine, as great, glorious, or amiable. We find our-
felves every where upheld by his goodneſs, and ſur-
rounded with an immenſity of love and mercy.
In
ſhort, we depend upon a Being, whoſe power quali.
fies him to make us happy by an infinity of means,
whoſe goodneſs and truth engage him to make thoſe
happy who defire it of him, and whoſe unchange-
ableneſs will fecure us in this happineſs to all eternity.
Such confiderations, which every one ſhould perpe-
tually cheriſh in his thoughts, will baniſh from us all
that ſecret heavineſs of heart which unthinking men
are ſubject to when they lie under no real affliction;
all that anguiſh which we may feel from any evil
that actually oppreſſes us, to which I may likewiſe
add thoſe little cracklings of mirth and folly, that
are apter to betray virtue than to ſupport it ; and
eſtablish in us ſuch an even and cheerful temper, as
makes us pleaſing to ourſelves, to thoſe with whom
we converſe, and to him whom we were made to
pleaſe,

The Advantages of Cheerfulneſs.
[From the fame. )
HEERFULNESS is, in the firſt place, the
beſt promoter of health. Repinings and ſecret
murmurs of heart give imperceptible ſtrokes to thoſe
delicate fibres of which the vital parts are compoſed,
and wear out the machine inſenſibly; not to men-
tion thoſe violent ferments which they ſtir up in the
blood, and thoſe irregular diſturbed motions which
they raiſe in the animal ſpirits. I ſcarce remember,
in my own obſervation, to have met with many
old
men, or with ſuch who (to uſe our Engliſh phraſe)
wear well, that had not at leaſt a certain indolence.
in their humour, if not a more than ordinary gaiety
and Cheerfulneſs of heart. The truth of it is, health
and Cheerfulneſs mutually beget each other; with
this difference, that we ſeldom meet with a great de-
gree of health which is not attended with a certain
Cheerfulneſs, but very often ſee Cheerfulneſs where
there is no great degree of health.
Cheerfulneſs bears the ſame friendly regard to the
mind as to the body: it baniſhes all anxious care and
diſcontent, foothes and compoſes the paſſions, and
keeps the ſoul in a perpetual calm. But having al.
ready touched on this laſt confideration, I ſhall here
take notice that the world, in which we are placed,
is filled with innumerable objects, that are proper to
raiſe and keep alive this happy temper of mind.
If we conſider the world in its ſubſerviency to man,
one would think it was made for our uſe ; but if we
conſider it in its natural beauty and harınony, one
would be apt to conclude it was made for our plea-
ſure. The fun, which is as the great foul of the
univerſe, and produces all the neceſſaries of life, has.
a particular influence in cheering the mind of man,
and making the heart glad.
Thoſe ſeveral living creatures which are made for
our ſervice or ſuſtenance, at the ſame time either fill

the rays
the woods with their muſic, furniſh us with game, or
raiſe pleaſing ideas in us by the delightfulneſs of their
appearance. Fountains, lakes, and rivers are as re-
freſhing to the imagination as to the ſoil through which
they paſs.
'There are writers of great diftinction, who have
made it an argument for Providence, that the whole
earth is covered with green rather than with any
other colour, as being ſuch a right mixture of light
and ſhade, that it comforts and ſtrengthens the eye,
inſtead of weakening or grieving it. For this reaſon
ſeveral painters have a green cloth hanging near
them, to eaſe the eye upon after too great an appli-
cation to their colouring. A famous modern philo-
ſopher accounts for it in the following manner: all
colours that are more luminous, overpower and diffi-
pate the animal ſpirits which are employed in fight;
on the contrary, thoſe that are more obſcure do not
give the animal ſpirits a ſufficient exerciſe; whereas
that produce in us the idea of green
fall
upon
the eye in ſuch a due proportion, that they give the
animal ſpirits their proper play, and, by keeping up
the ſtruggle in a juſt balance, excite a very pleaſing
and agreeable ſenſation. Let the cauſe be what it
will, the effect is certain ; for which reaſon the
poets afcribe to this particular colour the epithet of
Cheerful.
To conſider further this double end in the works of
nature, and how they are at the ſame time both uſe-
ful and entertaining, we find that the moſt important
parts in the vegetable world are thoſe which are the
most beautiful. Theſe are the feeds by which the
ſeveral races of plants are propagated and continued,
and which are always lodged in flowers or bloſſoms.
Nature ſeems to hide her principal deſign, and to be
induſtrious in making the carth gay and delightful,
while ſhe is carrying on her great work, and intent
upon her own prefervation. The huſbandman, after
the ſame manner, is employed in laying out the
whole country into a kind of garden or landſcape, and
making every thing ſmile about him, whilſt, in reality,

he thinks of nothing but of the harveſt and increaſe
which is to ariſe from it.
We
may
farther obſerve how Providence has taken
care to keep up this Cheerfulneſs in the mind of man,
by having formed it after ſuch a manner as to make
it capable of conceiving delight from ſeveral objects
which ſeem to have very little uſe in them; as from
the wildneſs of rocks and deſerts, and the like gro-
teſque parts of nature. Thoſe who are verſed in
philoſophy may ſtill carry this conſideration higher,
by obſerving, that if matter had appeared to us en-
dowed only with thoſe real qualities which it actually
poſſeſſes, it would have made but a very joyleſs and un-
comfortable figure; and why has Providence given
it a power of producing in uis ſuch imaginary quali-
ties as taſtes, colours, founds, and ſmells, heat and
cold, but that man, while he is converſant in the
lower ſtations of nature, might have his mind cheered
and delighted with agreeable ſenſations ? In ſhort,
the whole univerſe is a kind of theatre, filled with
objects that either raiſe in us pleaſure, amuſement, or
admiration.
The reader's own thoughts will ſuggeſt to him the
viciffitude of day and night, the change of ſeaſons,
with all that variety of ſcenes which diverſify the face
of nature, and fill the mind with a perpetual ſuccef-
fion of beautiful and pleaſing images.
I ſhall not here mention the ſeveral entertainments
of art, with the pleaſures of friendſhip, books, con-
verſation, and other accidental diverſions of life, be-
cauſe I would only take notice of ſuch incitements to
a cheerful temper, as offer themſelves to perſons of
all ranks and conditions, and which may ſufficiently
Thew us that Providence did not deſign this world
Thould be filled with murmurs and repinings, or that
the heart of man ſhould be involved in gloom and
melancholy.
I the more inculcate this Cheerfulneſs of temper,
as it is a virtue in which our countrymen are obſerved
to be more deficient than any other nation. Melan-
choly is a kind of demon that haunts our iſland, and

often conveys itſelf to us in an eaſterly wind. A cele-
brated French noveliſt, in oppoſition to thoſe who
begin their romances with the flowery ſeaſon of the
year, enters on his ſtory thus : “In the gloomy month
as of November, when the people of England hang
" and drown themſelves, a diſconſolate lover walked
out into the fields," &c.
Every one ought to fence againſt the temper of his
climate or conſtitution, and frequently to indulge in
himſelf thoſe conſiderations which may give him a
ſerenity of mind, and enable him to bear up cheer-
fully againſt thoſe little evils and misfortunes which
are common to human nature, and which, by a right
improvement of them, will produce a ſatiety of joy,
and an uninterrupted happineſs.
At the ſame time that I would engage my reader
to conſider the world in its moſt agreeable lights, I
muſt own there are many evils which naturally ſpring
up amidſt the entertainments that are provided for
us; but theſe, if rightly confidered, ſhould be far
from overcaſting the
mind with forrow, or deſtroying
that Cheerfulneſs of temper which I have been re-
commending. This interfperfion of evil with good,
and pain with pleaſure, in the works of nature, is
very truly aſcribed by Mr. Locke, in his Eſſay on
Human Underſtanding, to a moral reaſon, in the
following words:
“ Beyond all this, we may find another reaſon
" why God hath ſcattered up and down ſeveral de.
grees of pleaſure and pain, in all the things that
66 environ and affect us, and blended them together,
" in almoſt all that our thoughts and ſenſes have to
“ do with ; that we finding imperfection, diffatisfac-
“ tion, and want of complete happineſs in all the
6 enjoyments which the creatures can afford us,
“ might be led to ſeek it in the enjoyment of him,
" with whom there is fulnefs of joy, and at whoſe
right hand are pleaſures for evermore.”

OUGHT hourly oe looking up with gratitude
praiſo
to ine Creator of ny being, for having
formou ine of a diſpoſition that throws off every par-
ticle of ſpleen, and either directs my attention to
objects of cheerfulneſs and joy, or enables me to look
upon their contraries as I do on ſhades in a picture,
which add force to the lights and beauty to the
whole. With this happineſs of conſtitution, I can
behold the luxury of the times, as giving food and
cloathing to the hungry and naked; extending our
commerce, and promoting and encouraging the libe-
ral arts.
I can look upon the horrors of war, as
productive of the bleſſings and enjoyments of peace ;
and upon the miſeries of mankind, which I cannot
relieve, with a thankful heart that my own lót has
been more favourable.
There is a paſſage in (that truly original poem
called the Spleen, which pleaſes me more than almoſt
any thing I have read. The paſſage is this :
Happy the man, who, innocent,
Grieves not ar ills he can't prevent;
His ſkiff does with the current glide,
Not puffing pulld againſt the tide ;
He, paddling by the ſcuffling crowd,
Sees, unconcern'd, life's.wager row'd;
And when he can't prevent foul play,
Enjoys the follies of the fray.
The laughing philoſopher has always appeared to
me a more eligible character than the weeping one ;
but before I ſit down either to laugh or cry at the
follies of mankind, as I have publicly inliſted myſelf
in their ſervice, it becomes me to adminifter every
thing in my power to relieve or cure them. For

kind owe their riſe to inactivity, or idlenes of body
or mind. A free and briſk circulation of the blood
is abſolutely neceſſary towards the creating eaſineſs
and good humour; and is the only means of ſecuring
us from a reſtleſs train of idle thoughts, which can-
not fail to make us burdenſome to ourſelves, and dif-
ſatisfied with all about us.
Providence has therefore wiſely provided for the
generality of mankind, by compelling them to uſe
that labour, which not only procures them the ne-
ceſſaries of life, but peace and health to enjoy them
with delight. Nay, farther, we find how effentially
neceſſary it is that the greateſt part of mankind ſhould
be obliged to earn their bread by labour, from the
ill uſe that is almoſt univerſally made of thoſe riches
which exempt men from it. Even the advantages
of the beſt education are generally found to be inſuf-
ficient to keep us within the limits of reaſon and mo-
deration. How hard do the very beſt of men find it,
to force upon themſelves that abftinence of labour,
which the narrowneſs of their circumſtances does not
immediately compel them to ? Is there really one in
ten, who, by all the advantages of wealth and lei-
ſure, is made more happy in reſpect to himſelf, or
more uſeful to mankind? what numbers do we daily
ſee of ſuch perfons, either rioting in luxury, or
ſleeping in ſloth, for one who makes a proper uſe of
the advantages which riches give for the improve-
ment of himſelf, or the happineſs of others and
how
many do we meet with, who, for their abuſe of
the bleſſings of life, are given up to perpetual un-
eafineſs of mind, and to the greatelt agonies of bodily
pain?

Whoever ſeriouſly confiders this point, will diſcover
that riches are by no means ſuch certain bleſſings as
the poor imagine them to be: on the contrary, he
will perceive that the common labours and employ-
ments of life are much better ſuited to the majority
of mankind, than proſperity and abundance would
be without them.
It was a merciful fentence which the Creator paſſed
on man for his diſobedience, " By the ſweat of thy
66 face ſhalt thou eat thy bread;" for to the puniſh-
ment itſelf he ſtands indebted for health, ſtrength,
and all the enjoyments of life. Though the firſt pa-
radiſe was forfeited for his tranſgreſſion, yet, by the
penalty inflicted for that tranſgreſſion, the earth is
made into a paradiſe again, in the beautiful fields
and gardens which we ſee daily produced by the labour
of man. And though the ground was pronounced
curſed for his diſobedience, yet is that curſe fo ordered,
as to be the puniſhment, chiefly and almoſt ſolely, of
thoſe who, by intemperance or ſloth, inflict it upon
themſelves.
Even from the wants and weakneſſes of mankind,
are the bands of mutual ſupport and affection derived.
The neceſſities of each, which no man of himſelf can
fufficiently ſupply, compel him to contribute towards
the benefit of others; and while he labours only for
his own advantage, he is promoting the univerſal
good of all around him.
Health is the bleſſing that every one wiſhes to en-
joy ;- but the multitude are ſo unreaſonable, as to de-
fire to purchaſe it at a cheaper rate than it is to be
obtained. The continuance of it is only to be ſe-
cured by exerciſe or labour: but the misfortune is,
that the poor are too apt to overlook their own en-
joyments, and to view with envy the eaſe and afflu-
ence of their ſuperiors, not conſidering that the
uſual attendants upon great fortunes are anxiety and
diſeaſe.
If it be true that thoſe perſons are the happieſt
who have the feweſt wants, the rich man is more the
object of compaflion than envy. However moderate

his inclinations may be, the cuſtom of the world lays
him under a kind of neceffity of living up to his for.
tune. He muſt be ſurrounded by a uſeleſs train of
fervants ; his appetite muſt be palled with plenty,
and his peace invaded by crowds. He muſt give up
the pleaſures and endearments of domeſtic life, to be
the ſlave of party and faction. Or if the goodneſs of
his heart ſhould incline him to acts of humanity
and benevolence, he will have the frequent mortifi-
cation of ſeeing his charities ill beſtowed; and, by
his inability to relieve all, the conſtant one of making
more enemies by his refuſals, than friends by his be-
nefactions. If we add to theſe conſiderations a truth,
which I believe few perſons will diſpute, namely,
that the greateſt fortunes, by adding to the wants of
their poffeffors, uſually render them the moſt neceffi-
tous of men, we ſhall find greatneſs and happineſs to be
at a wide diſtance from one another. If we carry
our inquiries ſtill higher; if we examine into the
ſtate of a king, and even inthrone him, like our own,
in the hearts of his people; if the life of a father
be a life of care and anxiety, to be the father of a
people is a pre-eminence to be honoured, but not
envied.
This happineſs of life is, I believe, generally to be
found in thoſe ſtations, which neither totally ſubject
men to labour, nor abſolutely exempt them from it.
Power is the parent of difquietude, ambition of dif-
appointment, and riches of diſeaſe.
I will conclude theſe reflections with the following
fable.
" Labour, the offspring of Want, and the mother
" of Health and Contentment, lived with her two
“ daughters in a little cottage by the ſide of a hill,
great
diſtance from town. They were totally
6 unacquainted with the great, and had kept no
66 better company than the neighbouring villagers :
" but having a deſire of ſeeing the world, they for-
“ look their companions and habitation, and deter-
56 mined to travel. Labour went ſoberly along the

66 while Contentment went (iniling on the left, ſup

“ perpetual good humour, increaſing the vivacity of

“ In this manner they travelled over foreſts and
" through towns and villages, till at laſt they arrived
at the capital of the kingdom. At their entrance
" into the great city, the mother conjured her
“ daughters never to loſe fight of her; for it was
" the will of Jupiter, ſhe faid, that their ſeparation
It ſhould be attended with the utter ruin of all three.
á But Health was of too gay a diſpoſition to regard
66 the counſels of Labour; ſhe ſuffered herſelf to be
" debauched by Intemperance, and at laſt died in
6 child-birth of Diſeaſe. Contentment, in the ab-
• ſence of her ſiſter, gave herſelf up to the incite-
ments of Sloth, and was never heard of after;
66 while Labour, who could have no enjoyment
56 without her daughters, went every where in ſearch
66 of them, till ſhe was at laſt ſeized by Lallitude in
“ her way, and died in milery."

GOOD Temper is one of the principal ingre-
dients of Happineſs. This, it will be ſaid, is
the work of nature, and muſt be born with us : and
fo in a good meaſure it is, yet oftentimes it may
be
acquired by art, and always improved by culture.
Almoſt every object that attracts our notice, has its
bright and its dark ſide: he that habituates himſelf
to look at the diſpleaſing ſide, will four his diſpofi-
tion, and conſequently impair his happineſs; while
he who conſtantly beholds it on the bright ſide, inſen-
fibly meliorates his temper, and, in conſequence of
it,

it, improves his own Happineſs, and the Happineſs
of all about him.
Arachne and Meliſſa are two friends: they are
both of them women in years, and alike in birth,
fortune, education, and accompliſhments. They were
originally alike in temper too; but, by different
management, are grown the reverſe of each other.
Arachne has accuſtomed herſelf to look only on the
dark ſide of every object. If a new poem or play
makes its appearance with a thouſand brilliances, and
but one or two blemiſhes, ſhe flightly ſkims over the
paſſages that ſhould give her pleaſure, and dwells
upon thoſe only that fill her with diſlike. If you
Thew her a very excellent portrait, ſhe looks at ſome
part of the drapery which has been neglected, or to
a hand or finger which has been left unfiniſhed.
Her garden is a very beautiful one, and kept with
great neatneſs and elegancy; but if you take a walk
with her in it, ſhe talks to you of nothing but of
blights and ſtorms, of ſnails and caterpillars, and
how impofſible it is to keep it from the litter of falling
leaves and worm-caſts. If you fit down in one of
her temples, to enjoy a delightful proſpect, ſhe ob-
ſerves to you, that there is too much wood, or too
little water; that the day is too ſunny, or too gloomy;
that it is ſultry or windy; and finiſhes with a long
harangue upon the wretchedneſs of our climate.
When you return with her to the company, in hopes
of little cheerful converſation, the caits a gloom
over all, by giving you the hiſtory of her own bad
health, or of fome melancholy accident that has be-
fallen one of her daughter's children. Thus ſhe in-
ſenſibly finks her own ſpirits, and the ſpirits of all
around her, and at laſt diſcovers, ſhe knows not why,
that her friends are grave.
Melita is the reverſe of all this. By conſtantly
habituating herſelf to look only on the bright ſide of
objects, the preſerves a perpetual cheerfulneſs in
herſelf, which, by a kind of happy contagion, ſhe
communicates to all about her. If any misfortune

has befallen her, the conſiders it might have been
worſe, and is thankful to Providence for an eſcape.
She rejoices in folitude, as it gives her an opportu-
nity of knowing herfelf; and in ſociety, becauſe the
can communicate the Happineſs ſhe enjoys. She op-
poſes every man's virtues to his failings, and can find
out fomething to cheriſh and applaud in the very
worſt of her acquaintance. She opens every book
with a deſire to be entertained or inſtructed, and
therefore ſeldom miſſes what ſhe looks for. Walk
with her, though it be but on a heath, or a common,
and ſhe will diſcover numberleſs beauties, unobſerved
before, in the hills, the dales, the broom, brakes,
and the variegated flowers of weeds and poppies. She
enjoys every change of weather and of leaſon, as
bringing with it ſomething of health or convenience.
In converſation, it is a rule with her never to ſtart a
ſubject that leads to any thing gloomy or diſagree-
able; you therefore never hear her repeating her
own grievances, or thoſe of her neighbours, or (what
is worſt of all) their faults and imperfections. If any
thing of the latter kind be mentioned in her hearing,
ſhe has the addreſs to turn it into entertainment, by
changing the moſt odious railing into a pleaſant
raillery. Thus Meliſſa, like the bee, gathers honey
from every weed; while Arachne, like the ſpider,
fucks poiſon from the faireſt flowers. The conſe-
quence is, that of two tempers, once very nearly
allied, the one is for ever four and diſſatisfied, the
other always gay and cheerful; the one ſpreads an
univerſal gloom; the other a continual ſunſhine.
There is nothing more worthy of our attention
than this art of Happineſs. In converſation, as well
as life, Happineſs very often depends upon the
Nlightest incidents. The taking notice of the badneſs
of the weather, a north-eaſt wind, the approach of
winter, or any trifling circumſtance of the diſagree,

The bright-
neſs of the ſky, the lengthening of the days, the in-
creaſing verdure of the ſpring, the arrival of
any
little
piece of good news, or whatever carries with it the
moſt diſtant glimpſe of joy, ſhall frequently be the

the man of refinement will extract pleaſure from the
thunder-ſtorm to which he is 'expoſed, by remarking
on the plenty and refreſhment which may be expected
from ſuch a ſhower.
Thus does good manners, as well as good fenfe, di-
rect us to look at every object on the bright ſide; and
by thus acting, we cheriſh and improve both the
one and the other. By this practice it is that Meliſſa

the common infelicities of life. Though the world
is crowded with ſcenes of calamity, we look for the
moſt

very
little regard ; and fix our eyes upon the ſtate of
particular perſons, whom the eminence of their

fortune, without a thought of the thouſands that are
falling round hiin.
With the ſame kind of anxious veneration I have,
for many years, been making obſervations on the life
of Polyphilus; a man whom all his acquaintance
have, from his firſt appearance in the world, feared
for the quickneſs of his difcerninent, and admired
for multiplicity of attainments; but whoſe progreſs
in life, and whoſe uſefulneſs to mankind, has perhaps
been hindered by the ſuperfluity of his knowledge,
and the celerity of his mind.
Polypilus was remarkable at the ſchool for fur-
palling all his companions, without any viſible appli-
cation; and at the univerſity was diſtinguiſhed equally
for his ſucceſsful progreſs, as well through the rough
and thorny mazes of ſcience, as the ſmooth and
flowing paths of politer literature, without any ſtrict
confinement to hours of ftudy, or any remarkable
forbearance of the common amuſements of young
men.
When Polyphilus was at the age in which meir
uſually chooſe their profeſſion, and prepare to enter
into a public character, every academical eye was
fixed upon him ; and all were curious to inquire,
what this univerſal genius would fix upon for the
einployment of his life : and no doubt was inade but
that he would leave all his contemporaries behind him,
and mount to the higheſt honours of that claſs in
which he ſhould inliit himſelf, without thoſe delays
and pauſes which muſt be always endured by meaner
abilities.
Polyphilus, though by no means infolent or affum-
ing, had been ſufficiently encouraged, by uninter-
rupted ſucceſs, to place great confidence in his own
parts ; and was not below his companions in the in-
dulgence of his hopes, and expectation of the aito.
niſhment with which the world would be ftruck,
when 'firſt his luſtre ſhould break out upon
it; nor
could he help (for whom does not conſtant flattery
intoxicate?) to join ſometimes in the mirth of his
friends, at the ſudden diſappearance of thoſe who,

having ſhone a while, and drawn the eyes of the pub-
upon
their feeble luſtre, were now doomed to fade
away before him.
It is natural for a man to catch advantageous no-
tions of the condition, which thoſe with whom he
converſes are ſtriving to attain. Polyphilus, in a
ramble to London, fell accidentally among the phy-
ſicians, and was ſo much pleaſed with the proſpect
of turning philofophy to profit, and ſo highly de-
lighted with a new theory of fevers, which darted
into his imagination, and which, after having con-
fidered it a few hours, he found himſelf able to main-
tain against all the advocates for the ancient ſyſtem,
that he reſolved to apply himſelf to anatoiny, botany,
and chymiſtry, and to leave no part unconquered,
either of the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms.
He therefore read authors, conſtructed ſyſteins, and
tried experiments. But unhappily, as he was going
to ſee a new plant in flower at Chelſea, he met, in
croſſing Weſtminiter to take water, the chancellor's
coach. He had the curioſity to follow him into the
hall, where a remarkable cauſe happened to be tried,
and found himſelf able to produce ſo many argu.
ments, which the lawyers had omitted on both ſides,
that he determined to quit phyſic for a profeſſion, in
which he found it would be ſo eaſy to excel; and
which promiſed higher honours and larger profits,
without melancholy attendance upon miſery, mean
ſubmiſſion to peeviſhneſs, and continual interruption
of reſt and pleaſure.
He immediately took chambers in the Temple,
bought a common-place took, and confined himſelf
for ſome months to the peruſal of the ſtatutes, year-
books, pleadings, and reports. He was a conſtant
hearer of the proceedings in the courts, and began
to put caſes with reafonable accuracy. But he ſoon
diſcovered, by conſidering the fortune of lawyers,
that preferment was not to be got by acuteneſs, learn-
ing, and eloquence. He was perplexed by the ab-
ſurdities of attorneys, and miſrepreſentations made
by his clients of their own cauſes; by the uſeleſs an-
xiety

xiety of one, and the inceſſant' importunity of ano-
ther. He began to repent of having devoted himſelf
to a ſtudy, which was ſo narrow in its comprehenſion,
and could never carry his name to any other country;
and he thought it unworthy of a man of parts to ſell
his life only for money. The barrenneſs of his fel-
low ſtudents forced him generally into other com-
pany at his hours of entertainment: and, among the
varieties of converſation through which his curioſity
was daily wandering, he by chance mingled at a
tavern with ſome intelligent officers of the army.
A man of letters was eaſily dazzled with the gaiety of
their appearance, and ſoftened into kindneſs by the
politeneſs of their addreſs. He therefore cultivated
this new acquaintance; and when he ſaw how readily
they found, in every place, admiſſion and regard,
and how familiarly they mingled with every rank and
order of men, he began to feel his heart beat for
military honours; and wondered how the prejudices
of the univerſity ſhould make him ſo long inſenſible
of that ambition, which has fired ſo many hearts in
every age, and negligent of that calling which is,
above all others, univerſally and invariably illuſtri-
ous, and which gives, even to the exterior appearance
of its profeſſors, a dignity and freedom unknown to
the reſt of mankind.
Theſe favourable impreſſions were made ftill deeper
by his converſation with ladies, whoſe regard for ſol-
diers he could not obſerve, without wiſhing himſelf
one of that happy fraternity, to which the female
world ſeemed to have devoted all their charms and
their kindneſs. The love of knowledge, which was
ſtill his predominant inclination, was gratified by the
recital of adventures, and accounts of foreign coun-
tries; and therefore he thought there was no way
life in which all his views could ſo completely con-
center, as in that of a ſoldier. In the art of war" he
thought it not difficult to excel, having obſerved his
new friends not very much verſed in the principles
of tactics or fortification ; and therefore he ſtudied all
the military writers, both ancient and modern, and,

in a ſhort time, could tell how to have gained every
remarkable battle that has been loſt from the begin-
ning of the world. He often thewed, at table, how
Alexander ſhould have been checked in his conqueſts,
what was the fatal error at Pharſalia, how Charles of
Sweden might have eſcaped his ruin at Pultoway,
and Marlborough might have been made to repent
his temerity at Blenheim. He intrenched armies,
upon paper, ſo that no fuperiority of numbers could
force them: and modelled in clay many impregnable
fortreſſes, on which all the preſent arts of attack
would be exhauſted without effect.
Polyphilus in a ſhort time obtained a commiſſion ;
but before he could rub off the folemnity of a ſcholar,
and gain the true air of military vivacity, a war was
declared, and forces ſent to the Continent. Here
Polyphilus unhappily found, that ſtudy alone would
not make a foldier: for being much accuſtomed to
think, the fenfe of danger fank into his mind, and
he seit at the approach of any action that terror
which a ſentence of death would have brought upon
him. He faw that, inſtead of conquering their fears,
the endeavour of his gay friends was only to eſcape
them: but his philofophy chained his mind to its
object, and rather loaded him with ſhackles, than fur-
niſhed him with arms. He, however, ſuppreſſed his
miſery in filence, and paſſed through the campaign
with honour ; but found himſelf utterly unable to ſup-
He then had recourſe again to his books, and con-
tinued to range from one ſtudy to another. As I
uſually viſit him once a month, and am admitted to
him without previous notice, I have found him with-
in this last half-year decyphering the Chineſe lan-
guage, making a farce, collecting a vocabulary of the
obſolete terms of the Engliſh law, writing an in-
quiry concerning the ancient Corinthian braſs, and
forming a new ſcheme of the variations of the needle.

makes ſudden eruptions into the regions of knowledge,
and fees all obſtacles give way before him; but he
never ſtays long enough to complete his conquest, to
eſtabliſh laws, or bring away the ſpoils.
Such is often the folly of thoſe men whom nature
has enabled to obtain ſkill and knowledge on terms fo
caſy, that they have no ſenſe of the value of the ac-
quiſition; who are qualified to make ſuch ſpeedy
progreſs in learning, that they think themſelves at
liberty to loiter in the way ; and often, by turning
aſide after every new object, like Atalanta, loſe the
race to Nower competitors, who preſs diligently for-
ward, and whoſe force is directed to a ſingle point.
I have often thought them happy that have been
fixed, froin the firſt dawn of thought, in a determi-
nation to ſome ſtate of life, by the choice of one
whoſe authority may preclude caprice, and whoſe
influence may prejudice them in the favour of his
opinion. The general precept of conſulting the
genius is of little uſe, unleſs we are told how the
genius can be known. If it is to be diſcovered only
by experiment, life will be loft before the reſolution
can be fixed; if any other indications are to be found,
they may perhaps be very early diſcerned. At least,
if to miſcarry in an attempt be a proof of having
miſtaken the direction of the genius, men appear not
leis frequently deceived with regard to themſelves
than to others: and therefore no one has much rea-
ſon to complain, that his life, was planned out by
friends; or to be confident, that he ſhould either have
had more honour or happineſs by being abandoned
to the chance of his own fancy.
It was ſaid of the learned Sanderſon, that when he
was preparing his lectures, he hefitated ſo much, and
rejected ſo often, that at the time of reading he was
often forced to produce, not what was beſt, but what
happened to be at hand. This will be the ſtate of
every man, who, in the choice of his employment,
balances all the arguments on every fide. The com-
plication is fo intricate, the motives and objections fo
nuinerous ;

numerous ; there is ſo much play for the imagination,
and ſo much reinains in the power of others, that
reaſon is forced at laſt to reſt in neutrality; the de-
cifion devolves into the hands of chance; and, after
a great part of life ſpent in inquiries which can never-
be reſolved, the reſt muſt often paſs in repenting the
unneceſſary delay; and can be uſeful to few other
purpoſes, than to warn others againſt the ſame folly ;
and to ſhew that, of two ſtates of life equally con-
fiftent with religion and virtue, he who chooſes earlieſt,
and perſeveres in it, chooſes beft.
It is therefore of the utmoſt importance, that all
who have any intention of doing well for themſelves
or others, and acquiring a reputation ſuperior to the
common names, which are hourly ſinking into obli.
vion, and ſwept away by time among the refuſe of
fame, ſhould add to their reaſon and ſpirit the power
of perſiſting in their purpoſes ; ſince all the perform-
ances of human art, at which we look with praiſe or
wonder, are inſtances of the reſiſtleſs force of perſe-
verance. It is by this that the quarry becomes a pyra-
mid, and that diſtant countries are united with canals.
If a man was to compare the effect of a fingle ſtroke
of the pick-axe, or of one impreſſion of the ſpade,
with the general deſign and laſt effect, he would be
overwhelmed by the ſenſe of their diſproportion :
yet thoſe petty operations, inceſſantly continued, at
laſt ſurmount the greateſt difficulties; and mountains
are levelled, and oceans bounded, by the ſlendes
force of human beings.

good inſtrument out of tune, is awkward, harſh, and
diſagreeable. A courteous blockhead is, however,
a more acceptable guest, almoſt every where, than
a rude fage. Men are naturally, fo fond of them-,
ſelves, that they will rather mif-ſpend their time
with a complaiſant ape, than improve it with a ſurly
and thwarting philofopher. Every bow, or good
word, whenceſoever it comes, is taken by us as a
ſign of our importance, and a confeſſion of our me-
rit; and the neglect of that complaiſance, as a token
that we are thought of none : a reproach which, how-
ever filent, few care to bear.
Good Breeding is never to be learned by ſtudy;
and therefore they who ſtudy it are coxcombs, and
formalifts, and ſtiff pedants. The beſt bred men, as
they come to be fo by uſe and obſervation only,
practiſe it without affectation. You ſee Good Breed-
ing in all that they do, without ſeeing the art of it.
It is a habit ; and, like all others, acquired by prac-
tice. A weak and ignorant man, who has lived in
good company, ſhall enter a room with a better
grace, and ſay common things much more agreeably,
than a profound wife man, who lives by himſelf, or
with only ſuch as himſelf, and is above the forms of
the world, and too important to talk of indifferent
things, and to be like other people. A footman
employed in Howd'ye's ſhall addreſs himſelf to a
perſon of figure with more decorum, and make a
ſpeech with more eaſe, than a learned ferjeant, who
lives wholly over briefs; or the deep head of a col-
lege, occupied only in a momentous fcience. I have
known a man, who, with the learning of a whole
univerſity, had the manners of a clown, and the
ſurlineſs of a porter; not from the want of tenſe,
though that want be very conſiſtent with a world
of learning, but from living long in a college, and
dictating to boys and pupils, or with old fellows,
who had no more breeding than himſelf, and, like
bim elf, were fpoiled by living rarely upon the ſquare
with any other fort of people.

Good Breeding, therefore, is never to be learned in
a college, where the ſphere of converſation is ſo
narrow, where the diſtance between men is ſo great,
and where the old have none to teach the young.
Henee you generally ſee young men come from the
univerſities with a conceited air, and a quaint man-
ner, which often turn them into fops : they are ge-
nerally either pert or prim : the tone of their voice,
and the poſition of their muſcles, Shew their accom-
pliſhments before they have ſpoke two words: their
fep, and the manner of uſing their legs and arms,
do the ſame; and every joint about them, and every
action that they do, declares the place and way of
their education. As to the ſenior fellows, and heads
of houſes, they are ſuch ſtarched pedants, ſuch fo-
lemn mamamouches, and ſuch kingly old fops, that
from their mien you may know their characters, and
read their titles and preferments in their hats. They
carry the college about them wherever they go,
and talk at a table as they do at a lecture ; or, if ſoine-
times they break into gaiety, it is either imperious
or infipid, diſreſpectful or awkward, and always un-
graceful : they want a good manner, leſs conceit,
and the appearance, at leaſt, of more humility; all
which are only to be acquired by living abroad in the
world, and by converſing with all ſorts of men.
"This accuftoins one to treat all inen as they expect to
be treated ; and ſuch general good treatment given
to all is called Good Breeding.
Hence the breeding of courts is always the eaſieſt
and moſt refined. Courtiers have the conſtant ad.
vantage of living daily with the beſt bred men : be-
fides, having occafion for all ſorts of people, they
accuſtom themſelves to uſe all ſorts of people civilly.
By converfing with all forts, they can fall readily
it to all forts of ſtyles, and pleaſe every body by
talking to him in his own way. They find too, by
daily experience, and promiſcuous converſation, that
the difference between men and men is not ſo great,
as an unacquaintedneſs with men would generally
make

make it : they are, therefore, under no awe, nor
ſhinefs, in ſpeaking to the greateſt ; nor have any
general contempt for the meanelt: a contempt which
too often riſes from a wrong judgment, grounded
upon pride, and continued by inexperience. They
conſider, that as the greateſt can do them good, ſo
the meaneſt can hurt them : they are therefore re-
ſpectful without awe to thoſe above them, and
complaiſant without diſdain to thoſe below them.
Courts, therefore, are the beſt ſchools for Good Breed-
ing ;, and to be well bred we muſt live not only with
the beſt ſorts of men, but muſt be acquainted with
all ſorts.
The want of this general converſation may be one
reaſon why the country clergy are ſo often accuſed of
want of Breeding. They come from the univerſity
full of an opinion, that all that is to be learned, is to
be learned there; and believing themſelves to have
already every accompliſhment, often remain without
any. In their pariſhes they can learn nothing but
an additional pride, from feeing or fancying them-
ſelves the biggeſt men there. If there be a ſquire
in the place, he rarely mends them. If he have a
delicate taſte, he will not converſe with them : but
it frequently happens, that his taſte is as crude as
theirs, and conſiſts in eating much, and drinking
more, and talking loud. Froin this conceited edu-
cation, and narrow converſation, ariſes their impa-
tience of contradiction, and their readineſs to contra-
dict. I own that I am always cautious of reaſoning
with the vicar: his firſt argument is generally an af-
ſertion; and his next, an affront.
An engaging manner and a genteel addreſs may be
out of their power; but it is in their power to be
condeſcending and affable. When people are obliging,
they are ſaid to be well-bred. The heart and inten-
tion are chiefly conſidered : when theſe are found
friendly and fincere, the manner of ſhewing it, how-
ever awkward, will be kindly overlooked. Good
Breeding is artificial good nature; and complaiſance
is underſtood to be a copy of the inviſible heart.

When people are ſatisfied of one another's goodwill
and fincerity, the forins they ſhew them are generally
laid aſide. Between intimate friends there is little
ceremony, and leſs between man and wife.
Some,
however, is ſtill neceſſary, becauſe by ſigns and
actions the affections are ſhewn. But a courteous bè.
haviour, which is known to mean nothing, goes for
nothing, and is not neceſſary when the meaning is
known to be good. Expreſſions of kindneſs, when
they are not thought the marks and effects of kind-
neſs, are empty ſounds : and yet theſe unmeaning
expreſſions are neceſſary in life. We are not to de.
clare to every man whom we diſlike, how much we
diſlike him, nor to thew it by dumb ſigns. When a
man ſays, that he is my humble ſervant, he obliges
me: not by the words, which in common ſpeech
ſignify ſcarce any thing; but becauſe by theſe words
he ſhews that he thinks me worth notice. Good
Breeding therefore is then juſt, when the actions
which it produces are thought fincere: this is its
end and ſucceſs: it muſt ſeem produced by kindneſs
for the perſon for whom it is ſhewn.
Good Breeding is of fo great importance in the
world, that an accompliſhment this way goes ofteni
further than much greater accompliſhments without
it can do. I have known gentlemen, who, with mo-
derate parts and much Good Breeding, have been
thonght great men; and have actually come to be fo.
Great abilities alone make no man's perſon amiable ;
ſome have been unpopular with the greateſt, and
fome even ridiculous : but the gay, the eaſy, the
complaiſant man, whoſe chief abilities are in his be-
haviour, pleaſes and obliges all, and is amiable to as
many as he obliges. To learn this behaviour, people
muſt begin early. One who feis out in the world at
twenty, ſhall make twice as much progreſs in life,
as one who, with twice his ſenſe, ſets out at forty ;
becauſe he is then leſs ſuſceptible of the arts of life.
Habits are not to be got in a day; and after a certain
age, never. Forced complaitance is foppery; and
affected eaſineſs is a monſter. I have feen a world

of tradeſmen, and almoſt as many gentlemen, take
ſuch pains to be well-bred, that I have been in pain
for them : native plainneſs is a thouſand times better.
Complaiſance is ingenious flattery : it makes thoſe
to whom it is p.iid flatter themſelves, while they take
every act of complaiſance in others as the declaration
of merit in themſelves : and beyond a certain degree
it is not innocent. Courtiers know its efficacy fo
well, that to it alone no ſmall part of their power is
owing. Hence ſo many people have always been de-
ceived by civil words and kind looks. To know fpe-
culatively the deluſions of this art, is not fufficient to
put you upon your guard againſt it. A fair and plau-
fible behaviour, with a ready rote of kind expreſſions,
and all the appearances of fincerity, will be apt to
miſlead you in ſpite of your foreknowledge. They
will catch your ſenſes, and beat you off your theory
in politics. You muſt find their infincerity ſome
time before you will come to diſtruſt it. Their art
and your own felf-love will conſpire againſt you,
drive away your incredulity, and beget faith, as it is
often begot, againſt evidence and reaſon. You will
ſtill fatter yourſelf, that you are an exception to the
rule, though there never were another exception.
The credulity of ſome is perfectly incurable; many
have continued ſteady believers, in ſpite of daily
proofs and fatal experience, for twenty years toge-
ther. They were always perſuaded that every pro-
iniſe was at leaſt intended to be kept, and always
forgave the breaking it. The great man ſiniled gra-
ciouſly, bowed courteouſly, excuſed himſelf earneſtly,
and vowed to God that you ſhould have the next
thing. You miſcarried; and then, with a concerned
face, he vowed to God that he could not help it,
promiſed again with the ſame folemn vow, was a ain

dulity is the fruit of felf-love, of an opinion that we

and never be fo; that is, they muſt be extremely

Good Breeding is indeed an amiable and perfuafive
thing: it beautifies the actions, and even the looks
of men.
But equally odious is the grimace of Good
Breeding : in compariſon with this, bluntneſs is an
accompliſhment. The ape of a well-bred man is
juſt as offenſive as the well-bred man is agreeable :
he is a nuiſance to his acquaintance. I am affrighted
at the affected ſmile and the apiſh ſhrug. When theſe
foul copies of courtiers throw their civil grin in one's
face, it is as much as one can do to avoid ſpitting
in theirs. A ſtarched rogue forcing ſmiles, is a more
hideous fight than a mummy: he is a fugitive from
nature ; and it is notable impudence in ſuch a crea-
ture to pretend to be courteous.
As to ill-breeding, or rudeneſs, there is ſomething
ſtill worſe in it than its deformity : it is immoral; it
is uſing others as you would not be uſed.

is perpetually ſubječt; for God's fake, Madam, give
ine leave to tell you, that what you do is not at all
agreeable either with ſo good a Chriſtian, or ſo rea-
fonable and ſo great a perſon as your Ladyſhip appears
to the world in all other lights.
I know no duty in religion more generally agreed
on, nor more juſtly required by God Almighty, than
a perfect ſubmiſſion to his will in all things; nor do
I think any diſpofition of mind can either pleaſe him
more, or become us better, than that of being fatis-
fied with all he gives, and contented with all he takes
away. None, I am ſure, can be of more honour to
God, nor of more eaſe to ourſelves ; for if we con-
fider him as our Maker, we cannot contend with
him; if as our father, we ought not to diſtruſt himn;
ſo that we may be confident, whatever he does is in-
tended for good, and whatever happens that we in-
terpret otherwiſe, yet we can get nothing by repin-
ing, nor ſave any thing by refilting.
But if it were fit for us to reaſon with God Ale
mighty, and your Ladyſhip's lofs be acknowledged as
great as it could have been to any one alive, yet I
doubt you would have but ill grace to complain at the
rate you
have done, or rather as you do ; for the firſt
motions or paſſions, how violent foever, may be
par-
doned; and it is only the courſe of them which makes

them inexcuſable. In this world, Madam, there is
nothing perfectly good; and whatever is called fo, is
but either comparatively with other things of its kind,
or elſe with the evil that is mingled in its compo-
fition; ſo he is a good man that is better than men,
commonly are, or in whom the good qualities are
more than the bad ; ſo in the courſe of life, his condi-
tion is eſteerned good, which is better than that of
molt other men, or wherein the good circumſtances
are more than the ill. By this meaſure, I doubt,
Madam, your complaints ought to be turned into ac-
knowledgments, and your friends would have cauſe
to rejoice rather than condole with you : for the
goods or bleſſings of life are uſually eſteemed to be
birth, health, beauty, friends, children, honour,
riches. Now when your Ladyſhip has fairly con-
fidered how God Almighty has dealt with you in
what he has given you of all theſe, you may be left
to judge yourſelf how you have dealt with him in
your complaints for what he has taken away. But
if
you
look about you, and conſider other lives as
well as your own, and what your lot is in compariſon
with thoſe who have been drawn in the circle of
your knowledge; if you think how few are born
with honour, how many die without name or chil-
dren, how little beauty we ſee, how few friends we
hear of, how many diſeaſes, and how much poverty
there is in the world, you will fall down upon your
knees, and, inſtead of repining at one affliction, will
admire ſo many bleſſings as you have received at the
hand of God.
To put your Ladyſhip in mind of what you are,
and the advantages you have in all theſe points,
would look like a deſign to flatter you, but this I
may fay, that we will pity you as much as you
pleaſe, if you will tell us who they are that you

would ſhew his power, and put me in mind from
whom I held all the reſt ; would you think I had
much reaſon to complain of hard uſage, and never to
remember any more what was left ine, never to fora
get what was taken away?
It is true you have loſt a child, and therein all that
could be loſt in a child of that
age;
but
you
have
kept one child, and are likely to do ſo long; you
have the aſſurance of another, and the hopes of
many more.
You have kept a huſband great in ein-
ployment, and in fortune, and (which is more) in
the eſteem of good men : you have kept your beauty
and your health, unleſs you have deſtroyed them
yourſelf, or diſcouraged them to ſtay with you by
uſing them ill. You have friends that are as kind
to you as you can wiſh, or as you can give them
leave to be by their fears of loſing you, and being
thereby ſo much the unhappier, the kinder they are
But
you
have honour and eſteein from all
that know you ; or, if ever it fails in any degree, it
is only upon that point of your ſeeming to be fallen
out with God and the whole world, and neither to
care for yourſelf, or any thing elſe, after what you
have loft.
You will ſay perhaps that one thing was all to you,
and your fondneſs of it made you indifferent to every
thing elſe; but this, I doubt, will be fo far from
juſtifying you, that it will prove to be your
well as your misfortune. God Almighty gave you
all the bleſſings of life, and you ſet your heart wholly
upon one, and deſpiſe or undervalue all the reſt: Is
this his fault or yours ? nay, is it not to be very un-
thankful to Heaven, as well as very ſcornful to the
reſt of the world? Is it not to ſay, becauſe you have
loſt one thing God hath given you, you thank him
for nothing he has left, and care not what he takes
away? Is it not to ſay, ſince that one thing is gone
out of the world, there is nothing left in it which you
think can deſerve your kindneſs or eſteem? A friend

makes me feaſt, and ſets all before me that his
care or kindneſs could provide ; but I ſet my heart
upon one diſh alone, and if that happens to be thrown
down, I ſcorn all the reſt; and though he ſends for
another of the fame, yet I riſe from the table in a
rage, and ſay my friend is my enemy, and has done
me the greateſt wrong in the world have I reaſon,
Madam, or good grace in what I do ? or would it
become me better to eat of the reſt that is before me,
and think no more of what had happened, and could
not be remedied?
All the precepts of Chriſtianity agree to teach and
command us to moderate our paſſions ; tơ temper our
affections towards all things below; to be thankful for
the poffeffion, and patient under the loſs whenever
he that gave ſhall ſee fit to take away. Your ex-
treme fondneſs was perhaps as diſpleaſing to God
before, as now your extreme affliction ; and your
loſs may have been a puniſhment for your faults in
the manner of enjoying what you had.' It is at least
pious to afcribe all the ill that befalls us to our own
demerits, rather than to injuſtice in God; and it
becomes us better to adore all the iſſues of his Pro-
vidence in the effects, than inquire into the cauſes ;
for ſubmiſſion is the only way of reaſoning between
a creature and its Maker; and contentment in his
will is the greateſt duty we can pretend to, and the
beſt remedy we can apply to all our misfortunes.
But, Madam, though religion were no party in
your caſe, and that for ſo violent and injurious a
grief you had nothing to anſwer to God, but only to
the world and yourſelf; yet I very much doubt how
you would be acquitted.' We bring into the world
with us a poor, needy, uncertain life, ſhort at the
longeſt, and unquiet at the beſt; all the imaginations
of the witty and the wife have been perpetually bufied
to find out the ways how to revive it with pleaſures,
or relieve it with diverſions ; how to compoſe it
with eaſe, and ſettle it with ſafety. To ſome of
theſe ends have been employed the inſtitutions of
law.

lawgivers, the reaſonings of philoſophers, the inven-
tions of poets, the pains of labouring, and the ex-
travagances of voluptuous men. All the world is
perpetually at work about nothing elſe, but only
that our poor mortal lives ſhould paſs the eaſier and
happier for that little time we poflefs them, or elle
end the better when we loſe them. Upon this occa-
fion riches came to be coveted, honours to be eſteem-
ed, friendſhip and love to be purſued, and virtues
themſelves to be admired in the world. Now, Ma-
dam, is it not to bid defiance to all mankind to con-
demn their univerfal opinions and deſigns, if, initead
of paſſing your life as well and eaſily, you reſolve to
pats it as ill and as miſerably as you can you grow
inſenſible to the conveniences of riches, the delights
of honour and praiſe, the charms of kindneſs or
friendſhip, nay to the obſervance or applauſe of
virtues themſelves ; for who can you expect, in
thele exceſſes of paffion, will allow you to ſhew either
temperance or fortitude, to be either prudent or juft?
And for your friends, I ſuppoſe, you reckon upon
loſing their kindneſs, when you have ſufficiently
convinced them, they can never hope for any of
yours, fince you have none left for yourſelf or any
thing elſe. You declare upon all occaſions, you are
incapable of receiving any comfort or pleaſure in any
thing that is left in this world ; and I aſſure you,
Madam, none can ever love you, that can have no
hopes ever to pleaſe you.
Among the ſeveral inquiries and endeavours after
the happineſs of life, the ſenſual' men agree in pur-
fuit of every pleaſure they can ſtart, without regard-
-ing the pains of the chaſe, the wearineſs when it
ends, or how little the quarry is worth. The buſy
and ambitious fall into the more laſting purſuits of
power and riches; the ſpeculative men prefer tran-
quillity of mind before the different motions of
paſſion and appetite, or the common ſucceſſions of
deſire and ſatiety, of pleaſure and pain; but this
may ſeem too dull a principle for the happineſs of
life, which is ever in motion; and paſſions are per-
haps

haps the ſtings, without which they ſay no honey
is inade; yet I think all ſorts of men have ever
agreed, they ought to be our ſervants, and not our
maſters ; to give us ſome agitation for entertainment
or exerciſe, but never to throw our reaſon out of its
ſeat. Perhaps I would not always fit ſtill, or would
be ſometimes on horſeback; but I would never ride
a horſe that galls my fleſh, or ſhakes my bones, or
that runs away with me as he pleaſes, ſo as I can
neither ſtop at a river or precipice. Better no paſ-
fions at all, than have them too violent ; or fuch
alone, as, inſtead of heightening our pleaſures, afford
us nothing but vexation and pain.
In all ſuch lofles as your Ladyſhip’s has been,
there is ſomething that common nature cannot be
denied, there is a great deal that good-nature may
be allowed; but all exceſſive and outrageous grief or
lamentation for the dead, was accounted among the
ancient Chriſtians to have ſomething of heatheniſh;
and among the civil nations of old, to have ſomething
of barbarous ; and therefore it has been the care of
the firſt to moderate it by their precepts, and the lat-
ter to reſtrain it by their law. The longeſt time that
has been allowed to the forms of mourning by the cuſ-
tom of any country, and in any relation, has been but
that of a year, in which ſpace the body is commonly
fuppoſed to be mouldered away to earth, and to re-
tain no more figure of what it was; but this has been
given only to the loſs of parents, of huſband, or wife.
On the other ſide, to children under age, nothing
has been allowed; and I ſuppoſe with particular rea-
fon, (the common ground of all general cuſtoms)
perhaps, becauſe they die in innocence, and with-
out having taſted the miſeries of life, ſo as we are,
ſure they are well when they leave us, and eſcape
much ill, which would, in all appearance, have be-
fallen them if they had ſtaid longer with us. Be..
lides, a parent may have twenty children, and ſo his
mourning may run through all the beſt of his life, if
his lofles are frequent of that kind; and our kind-
nefs to children ſo young, is taken to proceed from

common opinions or fond imaginations, not friend-
Thip or eſteem; and to be grounded upon entertain;
ment, rather than uſe in the many offices of life;
nor would it paſs from any perſon beſides your
Ladyſhip, to ſay you loft a companion and a friend
at nine years old, though you loſt one indeed, who
gave the faireft hopes that could be of being both in
time, and every thing elſe that was eſtimable and
good : but yet, that itſelf God only knows, conſider-
ing the changes of humour and difpofition, which
are as great as thoſe of feature and ſhape the firſt fix-
teen years of our lives, conſidering the chances of time,
the infection of company, the ſnares of the world,
and the paſſions of youth; ſo that the moſt excellent
and agreeable creature of that tender
age,
and that
ſeemed born under the happieſt ſtars, might, by the
courſe of
years and accidents, come to be the moſt
miſerable herſelf, and more trouble to her friends by
living long, than ſhe could have been by dying young
Yet after all, Madam, I think your lofs ſo great,
and ſome meaſure of your grief ſo deſerved, that
would all your paſſionate complaints, all the anguiſh
of your heart, do any thing to retrieve it ; could
tears water the lovely plant, ſo as to make it grow
again after once it is cut down ; would fighs furniſh
new breath, or could it draw life and ſpirits from
the waſting of yours; I am ſure your friends would
be ſo far from acçuſing your paſſion, that they would
encourage it as much, and ſhare it as deep as they
could. But, alas ! the eternal laws of the creation ex-
tinguiſh all ſuch hopes, forbid all ſuch deſigns : na-
t ure gives us many children and friends to take them
away ; but takes none away to give them us again :
and this makes the exceſſes of grief to have been ſo
univerſally condemned as a thing unnatural, becauſe
ſo much in vain; whereas nature, they ſay, does
nothing in vain: as a thing ſo unreaſonable, becauſe
ſo contrary to our deſigns; for we all deſign to be
well, and at eaſe, and by grief we make ourſelves ill
of imaginary wounds, and raiſe ourſelves troubles
moſt properly out of the duſt, whilſt our ravings and
complaints

complaints are but like arrows ſhot up into the air, at
no mark, and ſo to no purpoſe, but only to fall back
upon our heads, and deſtroy ourſelves, inſtead of re-
covering or revenging our friends.
Perhaps, Madam, you will ſay, this is your de-
fign, or if not, your deſire; but I hope you are not
ſo far gone, or ſo deſperately bent: your Lad; ſhip
knows
very
well your life is not your own, but bis
that lent it you to manage, and preſerve the beít you
could, and not to throw it away, as if it came from
fome common hand. It belongs, in a great meaſure,
to your country, and your family; and therefore by
all human laws, as well as divine, ſelf murder has
ever been agreed on as the greateſt crime, and is pu-
niſhed here with the utmoſt ſhame, which is all that
can be inflicted upon the dead. But is the crime
much leſs to kill ourſelves by a flow foiſon, than by
a ſudden wound ? now if we do it, and know we do
it, by a long and a continual grief, can we think our-
ſelves innocent ? what great difference is there if we
break our hearts, or conſume them; if we pierce
them or bruiſe them; ſince all determines in the
fame death, as all ariſes from the fame deſpair? but
whạt if it goes not fo far? it is not indeed ſo bad as
might be, but that does not excufe it from being
very ill: though I do not kill my neighbour, is it
no hurt to wound him, or to ſpoil him of the conve-
niences of life? the greateſt crime is for a man to
kill himſelf: is it a finall one to wound himſelf by
anguiſh of heart, by grief or deſpair, to ruin his
health, to ſhorten his age, to deprive himſelf of all
the pleaſures, or eafes, or enjoyments of life!
Next to the miſchiefs we do ourſelves, are thoſe
we do our children and our friends, as thoſe who
deſerve beſt of us, or at leaſt deſerve no ill. The
child you carry about you, what has that done, that
you
ſhould endeavour to deprive it of life, almost as
foon as you beſtow it? or if at beſt you ſuffer it to
live to be born, yet, by your ill uſage of yourſelf,

health, and perhaps the very temper of its mind, by

giving it ſuch an infuſion of melancholy, as may
ſerve to diſcolour the objects, and difreliſh the acci-
dents it may meet with in the common train of life?
but this is one you are not yet acquainted with ;
what will you ſay to another you are? Were it a
ſmall injury to my Lord Capel to deprive him of a
mother, from whoſe prudence and kindneſs he may
juftly expect the cares of his health and education,
the forming of his body, and the cultivating of his
mind; the feeds of honour and virtue, and thereby
the true principles of a happy life? how has my
Lord of Eflex deſerved that
you
ſhould
go
about to
looſe him a wife he loves with ſo much paſſion, and,
which is more, with ſo much realon ; fo great an ho-
nour and ſupport to his family, fo great a hope to his
fortune, and comfort to his life? are there fo many
left of your own great family, that you ſhɔuld defire
in a manner wholly to reduce it, by ſuffering the
greateſt and almoſt lalt branch of it to wither away
before its time? or is your country, in this age, to
ſtored with great perſons, that you ſhould envy it
thoſe we may juſtly expect from fo noble a race !
Whilſt I had any hopes your tears would eaſe you,
or that your grief would confume itſelf by liberty and
time, your Ladyſhip knows very well I never once
accuſed it, nor ever increaſed it, like many others,
by the common formal ways of afluaging it; and
this, I am ſure, is the firſt offices of this kind I ever
went about to perform, otherwiſe than in the moſt
ordinary forms. I was in hope what was fo violent
could not be ſo long; but when I obſerved it to grow
ſtronger with age, and increaſe like a îtreain the
further it run; when I ſaw it draw out ſo inany un-
happy conſequences, and threaten no leſs than your
child, your health, and your life, I could no longer
forbear this endeavour, nor end it without begging
of your Ladyſhip, for God's fake, and for your own,
for your children's and your friends, for your coun-
try's and your family's, that you would no longer
abandon yourſelf to ſo diſconfolate a paflion, but that

ſhould not only have mingled my tears with yours,

ſelves, to be capable of adminiſtring comfort to others.
Nevertheleſs I thought proper to ſuggeſt a few re-
flections which occurred to me upon this occaſion :
not as imagining they would be new to you, but be-
lieving that, in your preſent diſcompoſure of mind,
they might poſſibly have eſcaped your attention.
Tell me then, my friend, wherefore do you indulge
this exceſs of ſorrow? reflect, I intreat you, in what
manner fortune has dealt with every one of us : that
ſhe has deprived us of what ought to be no leſs dear
than our children, and overwhelmed in one general
ruin our honours, our liberties, and our country.
And after theſe loſſes, is it poſſible that any other
ſhould increaſe our tears? is it poſſible that a mind,
long exerciſed in calamities ſo truly ſevere, ſhould
not become totally callous and indifferent to every
event ? but you will tell me, perhaps, that your grief
ariſes not ſo much on your own account as on that of
Tullia. Yet ſurely you muſt often, as well as my-
ſelf, have had occaſion, in theſe wretched times, to
reflect, that their condition by no means deſerves to
be regretted, whom death has gently removed from
this unhappy ſcene. What is there, let me aſk, in
the preſent circumſtances of our country, that could
have rendered life greatly deſirable to your daughter?
what pleaſing hopes, what agreeable views, what ra-
tional ſatisfaction could the poſſibly have propoſed to
herſelf from a more extended period? was it in the
proſpect of conjugal happineſs in the fociety of ſome
diſtinguiſhed youth ? as if, indeed, you could have
found a ſon-in-law, amongſt our preſent ſet of young
men, worthy of being intruſted with the care of
your daughter? or was it in the expectation of being
the joyful mother of a flouriſhing race, who might
poſſeſs their patrimony with independence, who might
gradually riſe through the ſeveral dignities of the
Itate, and exert the liberty to which they were born
in the ſervice and defence of their friends and coun-
try? But is there one amongſt all theſe deſirable pri-
vileges, of which we were not deprived before the
was in a capacity of tranſmitting them to her defcen-

dants ? yet, after all, you may ftill alledge, perhaps,
that the loſs of our children is a ſevere affliction ;
and unqueſtionably it would be ſo, if it were not a
much
greater
to ſee them alive to endure thoſe in-
dignities which their parents ſuffer.
I lately fell into a reflection, which, as it afforded
great relief to the diſquietude of my own heart, may
poſſibly contribute likewiſe to affuage the anguiſh of
yours. In my return out of Aſia, as I was failing
from Ægina towards Megara, I amuſed myſelf with
contemplating the circumjacent countries. Behind
me lay Ægina, betore me, Megara; on my right, I
ſaw Piræus, and on my left, Corinth. Theſe cities,
once ſo flouriſhing and magnificent, now repreſented
nothing to my view but a fad ſpectacle of defolation.
• Alas !" I ſaid to myſelf, 66 ſhall ſuch a ſhort-
" lived creature as man complain, when one of his
“ fpecies falls either by the hand of violence, or by
" the common courſe of nature, whilſt in this nar-
row compaſs ſo many great and glorious cities,
“ formed for a much longer duration, thus lie ex-
• tended in ruins? Remember then, O my heart,
66 the general lot to which man is born; and let
“ that thought fuppreſs thy unreaſonable murmurs."
Believe me, I found my mind greatly refreſhed and
comforted by theſe reflections. Let me adviſe you
in the ſame manner to repreſent to yourſelf, what
numbers of our illuſtrious countrymen have lately
been cut off at once, how much the ſtrength of the
Roman republic is impaired, and what dreadful de-
vaftation has gone forth throughout all its provinces !
and can you, with the impreſſion of theſe greater
calamities upon your mind, be fo immoderately
affi cted for the loſs of one fingle individual, a poor,
little, tender woman? who, if ſhe had not died at
this time, muſt, in a few fleeting years more, hare
inevitably undergone that common fate to which the
was born. Reaſonable, however, as theſe reflections
are, I would call you from them a while, in order
to lead your thoughts to others more peculiarly ſuit-
able to your circumſtances and character. Remem-

ber then, that your daughter lived as long as life was
worth poſſelling, that is, till liverty was no more ;
that ſhe lived to ſee you in the illuſtrious offices of
prætor, conſul, and augur; to be married to fome of
the nobleſt youths in Rome; to be bleit with almoſt
every valuable enjoyment; and at length to expire
with the republic itſelf. Tell me now, what is there,
in this vie v of her fate, that could give either her
or yourſelf juſt reaſon to complain? in fine, do not
forget that you are Cicero, the wiſe, the philoſophi-
cal Cicero, who were wont to give advice to others :
nor reſemble thoſe unſkilful empirics, who, at the
fame time that they pretend to be furnished with
remedies for other men's diforders, are altogether in.
capable of finding a cure for their own. On the
contrary, apply to your private uſe thoſe judicious
precepts you have adminiſtered to the public. Time
neceſſarily weakens the ſtrongeſt impreſſions of for-
row : but it would be a reproach to your character
not to anticipate this its certain effect, by the force
of your own good ſenſe and judgment. If the dead
retain any conſciouſneſs of what is here tranſacted,
your daughter's affection, I am ſure, was ſuch both
to you and to all her relations, that ſhe can by no
means defire you ſhould abandon yourſelf to this ex-
ceſs of grief. Reſtrain it then, I conjure you, for
her fake, and for the ſake of the reſt of your family
and friends, who lament to ſee you thus affi Eted.
Reſtrain it too, I beſeech you, for the ſake of your
country, that whenever the opportunity ſhall ſerve,
it may reap the benefit of your counſels and aſſiſtance.
In ſhort, fince ſuch is our fortune, that we muſt nee
ceffarily ſubmit to the preſent ſystem of public affairs,
ſuffer it not to be ſuſpected, that it is not ſo much
the death of your daughter, as the fate of the republic,
and the ſucceſs of our victors, that you deplore.
But it would be ill manners to dwell any longer upon
this ſubject, as I ſhould ſeem to queition the efficacy
of your own good ſenſe. I will only add, therefore,
that as we have often ſeen you bear proſperity in the

a ſtate of fluctuation, and we find this com-
plaint is conſtantly made by the ſenſible and judicious
in every age. Though the diction of the Romans is
likely to endure as long as time ſhall ſubfift, yet we
find that Horace, in one of his odes, ſeems to be
aware of the decay of words and phraſes, which die
away and are conſtantly ſucceeded by a ſudden birth
of new terms and modes of phraſeology. In ſeveral
other paſſages of his writings there are ſhort reflec.
tions upon this literary phenomenon, in which he
always appears to me to deliver himſelf with forrow
and regret. “ They fall," ſays he, “ like leaves,
" and are replaced by a new product; like young
" perſons, they flouriſh for a mort time, and then
“ tend to oblivion.” The compariſon is moſt certainly
very juſt; and as young men, in their bloom and
vigour, are faid to be upon town, it is the ſame with
words; they are alſo upon town for a time, and then
totally periſh. I have often thought that a weekly
bill of words would not be unentertaining to men of
letters; and if there was a proper regiſter-office for
the purpoſe, where their ſeveral births and burials
might be recorded with accuracy and preciſion, I
ſhould imagine it would furniſh no diſagreeable hiſ.
tory. A diſtinction might be made between a kind
of ſex in words, according as they are appropriated

If, for the ſatisfaction of the curious, a liſt ſhould
be furniſhed of the ſeveral terins that are born, or
that die away, with a ſhort account of the life and
character of each phraſe, whether it be born of honeſt
parents in England or Ireland, what company it kept,
whether it was Whig or Tory, Popiſh or Proteſtant,
it would in my opinion be an agreeable addition to
this hiſtory of the riſe and fall of words. There
might further be added an account of ſuch expreſſions
as might happen to be naturalized, with the objec-
tions of the learned, who ſhould think proper to
proteſt againſt ſuch a naturalization of foreigners
among the natives of this land. Such a procedure
could not fail to yield ſatisfaction to the curious; and,
though it would not prevent the inſtability of our
language, it would at leaſt diſplay the gradual ſteps
towards improvement or final deſtruction. For my
part, I have ever looked
upon
the
permanency of our
language to be of greater conſequence than the
ſtocks of whatever denomination; and for that rea-
fon, I ſhould be glad that ſome means were deviſed to
hinder the diction of our Shakeſpeare and Milton from
being obliterated, and to ſuſpend the evils which
Mr. Pope threatened us with, when he ſaid,
And ſuch as Chaucer is, ſhall Dryden be.
The dictionary which the learned Mr. Johnſon has
publiſhed, may in ſome meaſure anſwer this end;
and, in aid to that deſign, I have been for ſome
time paſt planning a dictionary of ſuch words as ap-
peared to me, from a concurrence of various cauſes,

to be moſt likely to be totally forg t. In order to
forward this undertaking I have annexed a ſpecimen of
the work, not as yet redui ed into alphabetical order,
but drawn out in fuch a manner as may ſerve to con-
vey to Mr. Ranger ſome idea of the intended work,
When the whole is con pleted, it may ſerve as a pro-
per companion to the Spectator, the Tatler, and all
the works of morality, which hare been publ fhed in
this country; and it may be contributing to make
our pofterity have ſome faint notion of what is meant
in many prices, when the viſible tendency of our
manners, to an entire change from ancient fimpliciy,
has almeſt effaced the ideas which the author intended
to exprels.
A Specimen of an Engliſh Dictionary.
CREATURE, A terın to ſhew our contempt of
any
perſon whom we diſlike, chiefly uſed by the ladies.
IMPERTINENT, A term of deriſion, applied by
the ladies to every man who ſpeaks ſenſe to them.
THING, Very often uſed to imply our diſlike,
but chiefly uſed to fignify our higheſt approbation,
Thus it is ſaid of a fine lady, She's ihe very Thing ;
or of a young fellow, Ola'an, he's the very Thing;
and fonietimes with limitation, as res, very well, but
1.0t the Thing
PATRIOT, A man who ſpeaks againſt the court
till he gets a place or penſion.
HONEST, This terin is derived from the Latin
word honeftum, which, among the Romans, implied
every thing that is honourable in a character. From
thence Pope was induced to ſay,
An honeſt man's the nobleſt work of God.
1
This is the original meaning of the word; in its con-
fequential ſenſe it is ſtrangely altered : honeſt now
fignifies gaming, drinking, and debauchery of every
ſort; it being common to lay of a man who is ad-

dicted to all theſe faſhionable vices, that he's an Ho-
neſi Fellow.
Good-NATURE, An old Engliſh word uſed by
our anceſtors; it is plain that it carried with it fome
allufion to the cuſtoms and manners of thoſe times,
but the uſage of the word being now quite altered,
there is no tracing it to its fource.
CHOCOLATE, The primitive intent of this word
was, a ſort of refreſhment which was taken by the
gentlemen and ladies for breakfast. In its metapho-
rical ſenſe it fignifies wit, humour, and pleafantry,
and he who can entertain his friends with all thele
brilliant qualities, is ſaid to give chocolate. The
etymology of this figurative expreſſion is derived
from Mr. Foote, almoit the only writer of his time.
This gentleman having prepared a rich mental re-
paſt, was obliged, to evade the cenſure of juſtices, to
invite his friends to drink chocolate with him in the
morning at the theatre in the Hay-Market, after
which he preſented ſeveral humorous dramatic pieces;
fince which, to give chocolate, is become a metapho-
rical term for every thing that is lively and ingenious.
Religion, An old Engliſh word for the wor-
ſhip of a Supreme Being, and the practice of ſocial
duties to our neighbour; probably a cuſtom known
to the ancient Druids.
VERY, A particle uſed by polite people for con-
ciſeneſs ; thus if you aſk, is not ſuch a book well
written ? a modern fine gentleman anſwers, Very.
HUMBUG, A lie.
WORTH, Originally it meant laudable qualities of
the mind; at preſent ſolely confined to a man's
fortune. Thus a ſcoundret of fifty thouſand is a
man of worth, and an honeſt man in indigence is
worth nothing
PARTY, Formerly fignified divifions in the ſtate,
at preſent it means a jaunt to Vauxhall, Bedlam,
Church, or any place of diverfion.
TRAGEDY, A name by which Shakeſpeare, Ot.
way, and ſome others intitled their dramatic writings;
the

the moderns retain the word, but have totally loft
the original ſenſe of it.
COMEDY, Probably a piece in which our rude
anceſtors repreſented the follies and characters of the
age; nothing of this ſort is at preſent known amongſt us.
DAMNED, When prieſtcraft prevailed in this
country, the people were frightened with ſtrange
ideas of hell, or a place of torture where the departed
fpirits of bad men were ſuppoſed to be confined. At
preſent it fignifies the higheſt praiſe we can confer.
Thus we ſay, A damned fine woman; a damned
charming crcature; a damned fine fillow, &c.
MARRIAGE, Alludes to a cuſtom among our an-
ceſtors of ſolemnly binding a man and woman to live
together for life: it reinained ainong us till lately ;
but was entirely aboliſhed by a marriage-act in the
year 1753.
DRUM, An inſtrument of warlike muſic uſed at
the inarch of an army, or in time of battle to animate
the ſoldiery : hence ſtyled by Shakeſpeare the ſpirit-
Stirring drum. It has not been uſed to any purpoſe
by the Engliſh ſince the days of the Duke of Marl-
borough. In its metaphorical ſenſe it means a party
of cards. (Vide Rout.) Note. Its ancient uſe begun
to revive in 1758.
FRIENDSHIP, An old Engliſh word uſed by our
anceſtors to fignify the complex idea of affection and
eſteem between two or more perſons, founded upon a
virtuous fympathy of tempers, and congenial habits
of virtue (for the meaning of the word Virtue, ſee in
its reſpective place.) This cuſtom was totally baniſh-
ed from among us in the reign of King Charles II.
and few or no traces of it have been diſcovered ever
ſince.
God, The ancient Druids, it is probable from all
hiſtorians, imagined that a ſuperior being ſuperin-
tended the direction of the univerſe, and the term
God, it is not unlikely, originally ſignified this
ſuperior being. But ſince it has been happily
out that every thing was made by chance, or that

nature (Vide Nature in its proper place) produced
every thing we behold; and ſince the properties of
matter have been ſufficiently detected by Lord Boling,
broke and others, the term God is totally exploded,
as merely expreſſive of ſome chimera, which has no
exiſtence.
Tucker, A bit of linen, cambric, or muſlin,
which the ladies uſe, to thew as much as poſſible of
their necks.
Modesty, Alludes to ſome cuſtom among the
ancient Britiſh ladies.
EARTHQUAKE, A party at cards. (Vide Rout,
Drum, or Hurricanc.)
FASHION, A polite term of excuſe for all the
vices that can be thought of.
NATURE, Nothing at all; it is often called Plaf-
tic Nature, Univerſal Nature, &c. but the idea is
always the ſame.
Rout, Formerly ſignified the defeat of an army,
and when the ſoldiers were all put to flight, or to the
fword, they were ſaid to be routed. The ladies, in
order to preſerve ſome idea of Creſſy, Poitiers, Blen-
heim, &c. have agreed to call their aſſemblies by the
name of Routs. This it is thought they do with
more propriety, as frequently at thefe' meetings
whole families are entirely routed out of houſe and
home.
Soul, It was formerly believed that in each hu-
man creature there exiſted ſomething incorruptible,
which was not to periſh with the diſſolution of our
bodies, but to be removed to ſome other part of the
univerſe, and there to enjoy the reward due to virtue,
or ſuffer condign puniſhment for all tranfgreſſions,
while in this ſtate of probation. But the happy diſ-
covery of the properties of matter has alſo baniſhed
this abſurd do&trine, which ſerves now to embelliſh
the fictions of poets.
IMMENSE, An epithet of praiſe; thus we ſay, An
immenſe fine woman, &c. (Vide Damned.)
Virtue, The ancient Druids made it a rule to
keep all their pallions in due government, by which
LS
means

means they were never known to prejudice their
neighbours, or hurt their own conſtitutions by in-
temperance, and this practice, it is probable, was
ſignified by the word Virtue. It is uſed by Shake-
ſpeare, Spenſer, Milton, Pope, and other poets, as
a pretty ornament for their romantic performances.
(Vide Friendſhip.)
Pity, This is alſo an old Engliſh word, the mean-
ing of which cannot be traced : it is now a word of
courſe, when we do not care a farthing for a friend
in affliction.
Yours, &c.

Pliny to Paternus.
[From Melmotl's Tranſlation of Pliny's Letters.]
VHE fickneſs which has run through my family,
and carried off ſeveral of
my
domeſtics, ſome of
them too in the prime of their years, has deeply
affieted me. I have two confolations, however,
which though they are not equal to fo conſiderable
a grief, ſtill they are confolations. One is, that
as I have always very readily manumiſed my ſlaves,
their death does not altogether ſeem immature, if
they lived long enough to receive their freedoms;
the other, that I have allowed them to make a kind
of a will *, which I obſerve as religioufly as if they
were legally intitled to that privilege. I receive and
obey their laft requeſts as ſo many authoritative com-
mands, fuffering them to diſpoſe of their effects to
whom they pleaſe; with this fingle reſtriction, that
they leave them to ſome in my family, which, to
perſons in their ſtations, is to be esteemed as a ſort of
commonwealth. But though I endeavour to acquieſce
under theſe reflections, yet the ſame tenderneſs
which led me to ſhew them theſe indulgences, ſtill
breaks out and overpowers my ſtrongeſt reſolutions.
However, I would not wiſh to be inſenſible to theſe

ſoft impreſſions of humanity; though the generality
of the world, I know, look upon loſſes of this kind
in no other view, than as a diminution of their pro-
perty, and fancy, by cheriſhing ſuch an unfeeling
temper, they diſcover a ſuperior fortitude and good
ſenſe. Their wiſdom and magnanimity I ſhall not
diſpute, but manly I am ſure they are not; for it is
the
very
criterion of true manhood to feel thoſe im-
preſſions of ſorrow which it endeavours to reſiſt, and
to adinit not to be above the want of confolation.
But perhaps I have detained you too long upon this
ſubject, though' not fo long as I would. There is
a certain pleaſure in giving vent to one's grief; eſpe-
cially when we pour out our ſorrows in the boſom
of a friend, who will approve, at leait pardon, our
tears. Farewell.
There is ſomething ſo uncommonly amiable in this
family piece, that the reader cannot be diſpleaſed with
being ſtopped a moment to take a ſecond view of it.
If nothing remained of Pliny but this fingular trait
of his charaéter, we might nevertheleſs affuredly pro-
nounce of him, that he was ennobled by every ſocial
virtue. For as it is certain the greateit minds have
ever been moſt open to impreſſions of the huinane
kind, ſo every moral virtue neceſſarily flows from
benevolence as from its true and genuine ſource. It
is impoſſible a man, who has a juſt feeling of the
calamities of others, can deliberately break through
the moral ties of any kind; becauſe it is certain he
cannot do ſo without being the occaſion of ſuffering
to thoſe who ſtand within the influence of the par-
ticular action. This principle alſo will ever afford
the moſt unnerring taſte of patriotiſm, or the pub-
lic affections ; for the cruel and unrelenting in pri-
vate and domcſtic life, can never act upon the true
notion of liberty, in the more enlarged relations of
public concerns. With great juſtice therefore our
author makes this generous principle the evidence of
manhood; as Juvenal deferibes a tenderneſs of dif-
poſition to be a principal note of diſtinction, which

at * Miſenum. On the 24th of Auguſt, about one
in the afternoon, my mother deſired him to obſerve
a cloud which appeared of a very unuſual fize and
ſhape. He had juit returned from taking the bene-
fit of the † ſun, and after bathing himſelf in cold
water, and taking a flight repait, was retired to his
ſtudy: he immediately aroſe and went out upon an
eininence, fro.n whence he might more dittinetly
view this very uncommon appearance. It was not
at that diſtance diſcernible from what mountain this
cloud iſſued, but it was found afterwards to afcend
from mount Veſuvius 1. I cannot give you a more
exact
* In the Gulf of Naples.
f The Romans uſed to lie or walk naked in the ſun, after
anointing their bodies with oil, which was eſteemed as greatly
contributing to health, and therefore daily practised by
them. This cuſtom, however, of anointing themſeives, is
inveighed againſt by the ſatiriits as in the number of their
luxurious indulgences : but ſince we find the elder Pliny
here, and the amiable Spurinna, in a former letter, practiſing
this method, we cannot ſuppoſe the thing itſelf was eſteemed
unmanly, but only when it was attended with ſome parti-
€ular circumſtances of an over-refined delicacy.
$ About fix miles diſtant from Naples.--This dreadful
eruption happened, A. D. 79. in the firſt year of the Empe-
ror Titus. Martial has a pretty epigram upon this ſubject,
in which he gives us a view of Veſuvius, as it appeared bea
fore this terrible confiagration broke out :
6 Hic eſt pampineis viridis Veſuvius umbris,
66 Prellerat hic madidos nobilis uva Lacus,
66 Hæc juga, quàm Nifæ colles, plus Bacchus amavit ;
“ Hoc nuper Satyri monte dederê choros.

" Hic locus Herculeo nomine clarus erat :
" Cuncta jacent flammis, & triſti merſa flavilla ;
" Nec vellent ſuperi hoc licuiffe fibi. Lib. 4. Ep. 44.
Here verdant vines o'erſpread Veſuvio's fides;
The gen'rous grape here pour'd her purple tides.
This Bacchus lov'd beyond his native ſcene;
Here dancing Satyrs joy'd to trip the green.

exact deſcription of its figure, than by reſembling it
to that of a pine tree, for it ſhot up a great height
in the form of a trunk, which extended itſelf at the
top into a fort of branches; occaſioned, I imagine,
either by a ſudden guſt of air that impelled it, the
force of which decreaſed as it advanced upwards, or
the cloud itſelf being preſſed back again by its own
weight, expanded in this manner: it appeared
ſometimes bright, and ſometimes dark and ipotted,
as it was either inore or leſs impregnated with earth
and cinders. This extraordinary phenomenon ex.
cited my uncle's philofophical curiofity to take a
nearer view of it. He ordered a light veſſel to be
got ready, and gave me the liberty, if I thought
proper, to attend him. I rather choſe to continue
my ſtudies; for, as it happened, he had given me
an employment of that kind. As he was coming out
of the houſe * he received a note from Rectina, the
wife of Baffus, who was in the utmoſt alarm at the
imminent danger which threatened her; for her villa
being ſituated at the foot of mount Veſuvius, there
was no way to eſcape but by ſea ; ſhe earneſtly in-
treated him therefore to come to her affiftance. He
accordingly changed his firſt deſign, and what he
began with a philofophical, he purſued with an he.
roical turn of mind. "He ordered the gallies to put
to ſea, and went himſelf on board with an intention
of aſſiſting not only Rectina, but ſeveral others; for

Now flaming embers ſpread dire waſte around,
And gods regret that gods can thus confound.
It ſeems probable that this was the firſt eruption of mount
Veſuvius, at least of any confequence; as it is certain we
have no particular accounts of any preceding one. Dio, in-
deed, and other ancient authors, ſpeak of it as burning be- !
fore; but ftill they deſcribe it as covered with trees and vines,
ſo that the eruptions muſt have been inconſiderable.

the villas ſtand extremely thick upon that beautiful
coaſt. When haſtening to the place from whence
others fled with the utmoſt terror, he ſteered his di-
rect courſe to the point of danger, and with ſo much
calmneſs and preſence of mind, as to be able to make
and dictate his obſervations upon the motion and
figure of that dreadful ſcene. He was now ſo nigh
the mountain, that the cinders, which grew thicker
and hotter the nearer he approached, fell into the
ſhips, together with pumice-ſtones, and black pieces
of burning rock : they were likewiſe in danger not
only of being a-ground by the ſudden retreat of the
ſea, but alſo from the vait fragments which rolled
down from the mountain, and obſtructed all the ſhore.
Here he ſtopped to conſider whether he ſhould re-
turn back again; to which the pilot adviſing him,
66 Fortune,” ſaid he, “ befriends the brave; carry
me to Pomponianus." Pomponianus was then at*
Stabiæ, ſeparated by a gulf, which the fea, after
ſeveral inſenſible windings, forms upon the ſhore.
He had already ſent his baggage on board ; for
though he was not at that time in actual danger, yet
being within the view of it, and indeed extremely
near, if it ſhould in the leaſt increaſe, he was deter-
mined to put to ſea as ſoon as the wind ſhould change.
It was favourable, however, for carrying my uncle
to Pomponianus, whom he found in the greateſt
consternation : he embraced him with tenderneſs, en-
couraging and exhorting him to keep up his fpirits ;
and, the more to diſſipate his fears, he ordered, with
an air of unconcern, the baths to be got ready ;
when, after having bathed, he ſat down to ſupper
with great cheerfulneſs, or at leaſt (what is equally
heroic) with all the appearance of it.
In the mean
while the eruption from mount Veſuvius flamed out
in ſeveral places with much violence, which the
darkneſs of the night contributed to render till more
viſible and dreadful. But my uncle, in order to

footh the apprehenſions of his friend, aſſured him it
was only the burning of the villages, which the
country people had abandoned to the flames : after
this he retired to reſt, and it is moſt certain he was
ſo little difcompoſed as to fall into a deep ſleep; for
being pretty fat, and breathing hard, thoſe who at-
tended without actually heard him ſnore. The court
which led to his apartment being now almoſt filled
with ſtones and aſhes, if he had continued there any
time longer, it would have been impoffible for him
to have made his way out; it was thought proper
therefore to awaken hiin. He got up, and went to
Pomponianus and the reſt of his company, who were
not unconcerned enough to think of going to bed.
They conſulted together whether it would be moſt
prudent to truſt to the houſes, which now ſhook
from ſide to ſide with frequent and violent concuſſions,
or fly to the open fields, where the calcined ſtones
and cinders, though light indeed, yet fell in large
ſhowers, and threatened deſtruction. In this diſtreſs
they refolved for the fields, as the leſs dangerous
ſituation of the two : a reſolution which, while the reſt
of the company were hurried into by their fears, my
uncle embraced upon cool and deliberate confidera-
tion. They went out then, having pillows tied
upon their heads with napkins; and this was their
whole defence againſt the ſtorm of ſtones that fell
round them. It was now day every where elſe, but
there a deeper darkneſs prevailed than in the moſt
obſcure night; which however was in ſome degree
diſſipated by torches and other lights of various kinds.
They thought proper to go down farther upon the
Thore to obſerve if they might fafely put out to ſea,
but they found the waves itill run extremely high
and boiſterous. There my urcle having drank a
draught or two of cold water, threw himſelf down
upon a cloth which was ſpread for him, when imme-
diately the flames, and a ſtrong ſmell of ſulphur
which was the forerunner of em, diſperſed the reſt
of the company, and obliged him to rile. He raiſed

and inſtantly fell down dead; ſuffocated, as I con-
jecture, by ſome groſs and noxious vapour, having
always had weak lungs, and frequently ſubject to a
difficulty of breathing. As ſoon as it was light again,
which was not till the third day after this melancholy
accident, his body was found entire, and without
any marks of violence upon it, exactly in the ſame
poiture that he fell, and looking more like a man
atleep than dead. During all this time my mother
and I were at Miſenum.But as this has no con-
nection with your hiſtory; fo your inquiry went no
farther than concerning my uncle's death ; with that
therefore I will put an end to my letter : ſuffer me
only to add, that I have faithfully related to you
what I was either an eye-witneſs of myſelf, or re-
ceived immediately after the accident happened, and
before there was time to vary the truth. You will
chooſe out of this narrative ſuch circumſtances as
shall be moſt ſuitable to your purpoſe : for there is a
great difference between what is proper for a letter,
and an hiſtory; between writing to a friend, and
writing to the public. Farewell.

as they are extremely frequent in Campania; but
they were to particularly violent that nighi, that they
not only ſhock every thing a' out us, but ſeemed in-
deed to threaten total deſtruction. My mother flew
my chamber, where ſhe found me riſing in order
to awaken her. We went out into a ſmall court be.
longing to the houſe, which ſeparated the ſea from
the buildings. As I was at that time but eighteen
years of age, I know not whether I ſhould call my
behaviour in this d ngerous juncture, courage or
raſhneſs; but I took up Livy, and amuſed myſelf
with turning over that author, and even making ex.
tracts from him, as if all about me had been in full
fecurity. While we were in this poſture, a friend
of my uncle's, who was juít come from Spain to pay
him a viſit, joined us, and obſerving me fitting by
my mother with a book in my hand, greatly con-
demned her calmneſs, at the ſame time that he re-
proved me for my careleſs fecurity: nevertheleſs I ſtill
went on with my author. Though it was now morn-
ing, the light was exceedingly faint and languid;
the buildings all around us tottered, and though we
ſtood upon open ground, yet as the place was narrow
and confined, there was no remaining there without
certain and great danger; we therefore reſolved to
quit the town. The people followed us in the ut-
moſt conſternation, and (as to a mind diſtraeted with
terror, every ſuggeſtion ſeems more prudent than its
own) preſſed in great crowds about us in our way out.
Being got at a convenient diftance from the houſes,
we ſtood ſtill, in the midſt of a moſt dangerous and
dreadful ſcene. The chariots, which we had ordered
to be drawn out, were ſo agitated backwards and
forwards, though upon the moſt level ground, that
we could not keep them ſteady, even by ſupporting
them with large ſtones. The ſea ſeemed to roll
back upon itſelf, and to be driven from its banks by

leait the ſhore was conſiderably enlarged, and ſeveral
ſea-anim ils were left upon it. On the other ſide, a
black and dre.dful cloud burſting with an izneous
ferpentine vapor, dirted out a long train of fire, re-
ſembling flaſhes of lightning, but much larger.
Upon this our Spinith friend, whoin I mentioned
above, addreſſing himſelf to my mother and me with
greater warmth and earneftneſs : “ If your brother
" and your uncle,” faid he, “ is fafe, he certainly
" wilhes you may be fo too; but if he periſhed, it
was his deſire no doubt, that you might both ſur-
si vive him : why therefore do you delay your eſcape
a inoinent?" We couid never think of our own
ſafety, we faid, while we were uncertain of his.
Hereupon our friend left us, and withdrew froin the
danger with the utmoit precipitation. Soon after-
wards the cloud ſeemed to defiend and cover the
whole ocean; as indeed, it entirety hid the iſland of *
Caprea, and the promontory of Miſenum. My
mother ſtrongly conjured me to make my eſcape at
any rate, which as I was young I might eaſily do:
as for herſelf, ſhe ſaid, her age and corpulency ren-
dered all attempts of that fort impoſſible; however
ſhe would willingly meet death, if the could have the
fitisfaction of ſeeing that ſhe was not the occaſion of
mine. But I abſolutely refuſed to leave her, and
taking her by the hand, I led her on : The complied
with great reluctance, and not without many re-
proaches to her elf for retarding my flight. The
aſhes now began to fall upon us, though in no great
quantity. I turned my head, and obſerved behind
us a thick ſinoke, which came rolling after us like a
torrent. I propoſed, while we had yet any light, to
turn out of the high road, left the ſhould be preſſed

was to be heard but the ſhrieks of women, the ſcreams
of children, and the cries of men; ſome calling for
their children, others for their parents, others for
their huſbands, and only diſtinguiſhing each other by
their voices ; one lamenting his own fate, another
that of his family ; ſome wiſhing to die, from the
very fear of dying ; ſome lifting their hands to the
gods; but the greater part imagining that the laſt
and eternal night was come, which was to deſtroy
both the * gods and the world together. Among
theſe there was ſome who augmented the real terrors
by imaginary ones, and made the frighted multitude
fallely believe that Miſenum was actually in Hames.
At length a glimmering light appeared, which we
imagined to be rather the forerunner of an approach-
ing Lurit of fames, (as in truth it was) than the re-
turn of day : however, the fire fell at a diſtance from
us : then again we were immerſed in thick darkneſs,
and a heavy ſhower of afhes rained upon us, which we
were obliged every now and then to ſake off, otherwiſe
we ſhould have been cruſhed and buried in the heap.
I might boaſt that, during all this ſcene of horror,
not a ſigh or expreſſion of fear eſcaped from me, had
not my ſupport been founded in that miſerable,
though ſtrong conſolation, that all mankind were in
volved in the ſame calamity, and that I imagined I
was periſhing with the world itſelf. At laſt this
dreadful darkneſs was diffipated by degrees, like a
cloud or ſmoke; the real day returned, and even the
fun appeared, though very faintly, and as when an
eclipſe is coming on. Every object that preſented
itſelf to our eyes, (which were extremely weakened)
ſeemed changed, being covered with white t aſhes, as

Sarah Drew mię ht be rather called comely than leau-
tiful, and was about the fame age. They had palied
throu h the various labours of the year together,
with the greateſt ſatisfaction. If the milked, it was
his morning and evening care to bring the cows to
her hand. It was but laſt fair that he bought her a
preſent of green filk for her ſtraw hat, and the pofy
on her ſilver ring was of his chooſing. Their love
was the talk of the whole neighbourhood; for fcandal
never affirmed that he had any other views than the
lawful pofleffion of her in marriage. It was that
very morning hat he had obtained the conſent of her
parents, and it was but till the next week that they
were to wait to be happy: perhaps in the intervals of
the r work they were now talking of their wedding-
cloaths, and John was ſuiting ſeveral ſorts of poppies
and field-flowers to her complexion, to chooſe her a
knot for her wedding day. While they were thus
bufied (it was on the laſt of July, between two and
three in the afternoon) the clouds grew black, and
ſuch a ſtorm of lightning and thunder enſued, that
all the labourers made the beſt of their way to what
ſhelter the trees and hedges atforded.
Sarah was frighted, and fell down in a ſwoon on a
heap of barley. John, who never ſeparated from
her, fit down by her fid-, having raked together two
or three heaps, the betier to ſecure her from the
form. Immediately there was heard ſo loud a crack,
as if heaven had ſplit aſunder ; every one was now
folicitous for the ſafety of his neighbour, and called
for one another throughout the field : no anſwer be-
ing returned to thoſe who called to our lovers, they
ſtept to the place where they lay; they perceived the
barley all in a ſmoke, and ſpied this faithful pair,
John with one arm about Sarah's neck, and the
other held over, as to ſcreen her from the lightning.
They were ſtruck dead, and ſtiffened in this tender
poſture. Sarah's left eyebrow was finged, and there
appeared a black ſpot on her breast : her lover was
all over black; but not the leaſt fign of life was found
in either. Attended by their melancholy companions,

they were conveyed to the town, and the next day
interred in Stanton-Harcourt church-yard. My Lord
Harcourt, at Mr. Pope’s and my rejueſt, has cauſed
a ſtone to be placed over them, upon condition that
we furniſh the epitaph, which is as follows:
When eiſtern lovers feed the fun'ral fire,
On the fanne pile the faithful p:ir expire:
Here p tying Heaven th.lt virtue mutual found,
And blailed both, that it ini ht neither wound.
Hearts to fincere th' Almighty law well pleas’d,
Sent his own lightning, and the victims leiz'd.
But my Lord is apprehenſive the country people
will not underitand this; and Mr. Pope fays he will
make one with ſomething of ſcripture in it, and with
as little of poetry as Hopkins and Sternhold.

The Epitaph was this :
Near this place lie the bodies of
JOHN HEwir and MARY Drew,
an induſtrious young inan
and virtuous maiden of this pariſh;
who being at h rveſt work,
(with ſeveral others)
were, in one inſtant, killed by lightning,
the laſt day of July, 1718.
Think not, by rig'rous judgment ſeiz'd,
A pair ſo faithful could expire ;
Victims fo pure Heav'n law well pleas’d,
And ſnatch'd them in eieitial fire.
Live well and fear no fuduen fate;
When God calls virtue to the grave,

Dover, Nov. 1. O. S. 1718.
HAVE this minute received a letter of yours
ſent me froin Paris. I believe and hope I ſhall
very ſoon fee both you and Mr. Congreve; but as I
am here in an inn, where we ſay to regulate our
march to London, bag and baggage, I fall employ
fome part of my leiſure time in anſwering that part
of yours that ſeems to require an anſwer.
I muſt applaud your good-nature in fuppofing that
your paftoral lovers (vulgarly called hay-makers)
would have lived in everlaſting joy and harmony, if
the lightning had not interrupted their ſcheme of
happineſs. I ſee no reaſon to imagine that John
Hewit and Sarah Drew were either wiſer or more
virtuous than their neighbours. That a well-ſet
man of twenty-five ſhould have a fancy to marry a
brown woman of eighteen, is nothing marvellous ;
and I cannot help thinking that, had they married,
their lives would have paſſed in the common track
with their fellow-pariſhioners. His endeavouring to
ſhield her from a ſtorm was a natural action, and
what he would certainly have done for his horſe, if
he had been in the fame ſituation. Neither am I of
opinion that their ſudden death was a reward of their
mutual virtue. You know the Jews were reproved
for thinking a village deſtroyed by fire more wicked
than thoſe that had eſcaped the thunder. Time and
chance happen to all men. Since you deſire me to
try my ſkill in an epitaph, I think the following lines
perhaps more juſt, though not ſo poetical as yours.
Here lie John Hewit and Sarah Drew;
Perhaps you'll ſay, What's that to you?

On that poor couple that are dead.

On Sunday next they ſhould have married ;
But ſee how oddly things are carried !
On Thurfday laſt it rain'd and lighten'd,
Theſe tender lovers fadly frighten'd,
Shelter'd beneath the cocking hay,
In hopes to paſs the time away.
But the bold thunder found them out,
(Commiſſion'd for that end, no doubt)
And ſeizing on their trembling breath,
Confign'd them to the ſhades of death.

ſelf very happy in that he had got ſo agreeable a
companion. Wherefore, reſolving to take their for-
tunes together, they always lodged in the ſame
houſe. Some few days travels had overpaſt before
the Eremite took notice of any thing remarkable.
But at laſt he obſerved that his fellow-traveller, with
whom he had contracted ſo intimate a friendſhip, in
an houſe where they were extraordinary well treated,
1tole away a gilt cup from the gentleman of the
houſe, and carried it away with him. The Eremite
was very much aſtoniſhed with what he ſaw done by
ſo fair and agreeable a perſon as he conceived hiin to
be ; but thought not yet fit to ſpeak to him, or ſeem
to take notice of it. And therefore they travel fairly
on together as aforetimes, until night forced them
to ſeek lodging. But they light upon ſuch an houſe
as had a very unhoſpitable owner, who ſhut them out
into the outward court, and expoſed them all night
to the injury of the open weather, which chanced
then to be very rainy : but the Eremite's fellow-tra-
veller unexpectedly compenſated his hoft's ill enter-
tainment with no meaner a reward than the gilt cup
he had carried away from the former place, thruſting
it in at the window when they departed. This the
Eremite thought was very pretty, and that it was
not covetouſneſs, but humour, that made him take it
away from its firſt owner. The next night, where
they lodged, they were treated again with a great
deal of kindneſs and civility ; but the Eremite ob-
ſerved with horror that his fellow-traveller, for an
ill requital, ſtrangled privately a young child of their
ſo courteous hoit in the cradle. This perplexed the
mind of the poor Eremite very much; but in ſadneſs
and patience forbearing to ſpeak, he travelled another
day's journey with the young man, and at evening
took up in a place where they were more made of
than any where hitherto; and becauſe the way they
were to travel the next morning was not ſo eaſy to
find, the maſter of the houſe commanded one of his
ſervants to go part of the way to direct them ; whom,
while they were paſſing over a itone bridge, the Ere-
mite's

mite's fellow-traveller caught ſuddenly betwixt the
legs, and pitched him headlong from off the bridge
into the river, and drowned him. Here the Eremite
could have no longer patience, but flew bitterly upon
his fellow-traveller for theſe barbarous actions, and
renounced all friendſhip with him, and would travel
with him no longer, nor keep him company. Where-
upon the young man ſmiling at the honeſt zeal of
the Eremite, and putting off his mortal diſguiſe, ap-
peared, as he was, in the form and luſtre of an angel
of God, and told him that he was ſent to eaſe his
mind of the great anxiety it was incumbered with
touching the Divine Providence. In which, ſaid
he, nothing can occur inore perplexing and paradoxi-
cal than what you have been offended at, ſince we
two travelled together. But yet I will demonſtrate
to you, laid he, that all I have done is very juſt and
right. For as for that firſt man from whom I took
the gilded cup, it was a real compenſation indeed of
his hoſpitality ; that cup being ſo forcible an occaſion
of the good man's diſtempering himſelf, and of ha-
zarding his health and life, which would be a great
loſs to his poor neighbours, he being of ſo good and
charitable a nature. But I put it into the window
of that harſh and unhoſpitable man that uſed us ſo
ill, not as a booty to him, but as a plague and ſcourge
to him, and for an eaſe to his oppreſſed neighbours,
that he may fall into intemperance, diſeaſes, and
death itſelf. For I knew very well that there was
that inchantment in this cup, that they that had it
would be thus bewitched with it. And as for that
civil perſon whoſe child I ftrangled in the cradle, it
was in great mercy to him, and no real hurt to the
child, who is now with God. But if that child had
lived, whereas this gentleman hitherto had been
piouſly, charitably, and devoutly given, his mind, I
faw, would have unavoidably ſunk into the love of the
world out of love to his child, he having had none
before, and doting ſo hugely on it; and therefore I
took away this momentary life from the body of the
child, that the ſoul of the father might live for ever.

was the moſt faithful piece of gratitude I could do to
one that had uſed us ſo humanely and kindly as that

buſineſs, into wealth and confideration ; ſo that his
good fortune appeared at once the effect and reward
of his induſtry and virtue. Of theſe he counter-
feited the appearances ſo well, that he grew into
great credit, married into a good family, and by lay-

continued to fill it with no finall applauſe, both as a
governor and a judge; until one day, as he fat on
the bench with fome of his brethren, a criminal was
brought before them, who was accuſed of having
murdered his maſter. The evidence came out full,
the jury brought in their verdict that the priſoner
was guilty, and the whole aſſembly waited the ſen-

much at heart. I fhill therefore explain myſelf
fully, nor bluſh to reaſon on principles that are out
of faſhion among men who intend nothing by ſerving
the public, but to feed their avarice, their vanity,
and their luxury, without the ſenſe of any duty they
owe to God or man.
It ſeems to me, that in order to maintain the mo-
ral ſyſtem of the world at a certain point, far below
that of ideal perfection, (for we are made capable of

conceiving what we are incapable of attaining) but
however ſufficient, upon the whole, to conſtitute a
ftate eaſy and happy, or at the worſt toleravle; I
ſay, it ſeems to me, that the Author of nature has
thought fit to mingle, from time to time, among
the ſocieties of men, a few, and but a few of thoie,
on whom he is graciouſly pleaſed to bestow a larger
proportion of the ethereal ſpirit than is given in the
ordinary courſe of his providence to the fons of men.
Theſe are they who engrofs almoſt the whole reaton
of the ſpecies, who are born to inſtruct, to guide,
and to preſerve ; who are deſigned to be the tutors
and the guardians of human kind.
When they
prove fuch, they exhibit to us examples of the
higheſt virtue and the trueſt piety; and they deſerve
to have their feſtivals kept, inſtead of that pack of
Anachorites and Enthuſiaſts, with thoſe names the
Calendar is crowded and diſgraced. When theſe
men apply their talents to other purpoſes, when they
Itrive to be great and deſpiſe being good, they com-
mit a moſt facrilegious breach of truſt; they per-
vert the means, they defeat, as far as lies in them,
the deſigns of Providence, and diſturb, in ſome fort,
the ſyſtem of Infinite Wiſdom. To miſapply theſe
talents is the moſt diffuſed, and therefore the greateſt
of crimes in its nature and conſequences; but to
keep them unexerted and unemployed, is a crime

always perceived by others, perhaps not always felt
by themſelves, that they were born for ſomething
more, and better. Theſe are the men to whom the
part I mentioned is aſſigned : their talents denote
their general deſignation, and the opportunities of
conforming themſelves to it, that ariſe in the courſe
of things, or that are preſented to them by any cir-
cumſtances of rank and fituation in the ſociety to.
which they belong, denote the particular vocation
which it is not lawful for them to refift, nor even to
neglect. The duration of the lives of ſuch men
as theſe is to be determined, I think, by the length
and importance of the parts they act, not by the
number of years that pals between their coming into
the world and their going out of it. Whether the
piece be of three or five acts, the part may be
long; and he who fuftains it through the whole,
may be ſaid to die in the fulneſs of years; whilft he,
who declines it ſooner, inay be ſaid not to live out half
his days.
On the Duty of Children to Parents.
HE courſe and compaſs of God's providence,
TH
and his methods of eſtabliſhing and evidencing
the meaſures of reciprocal duty, is no where more
remarkable than in the mutual obligations between
parents and their children.
The child comes into the world naked and helpleſs,
and from himſelf more deſtitute of the natural means
of ſecurity and ſupport, than almoſt any of the infe-
rior creatures. In this exigency the paternal care
and tenderneſs ſteps in to his relief, ſupplies all his
neceſſities, and relieves all his wants ; bears with all
his untowardly difpofitions, at an age when he is
neither capable of being corrected or convinced ; and
not only provides the propereſt food for him, when
he is incapable of providing any for himſelf, but like-
wiſe adminiſters it when he is incapable of feeding
himſelf; bears with all degrees of his folly and im
pertinence,

pertinence, liſtens to all his trifling and idle inquiries,
not only with patience, but with pleaſure, until
they gradually conduct him to health, and ſtrength,
and knowledge.
But the child is not long arrived at this perfection
of his nature, before his parents begin to fall gradually
into the fame infirmities through which they but
lately conducted and ſupported their children, and 10
need the fame aſſiſtance which they lately lent. Anil
firſt they begin to grow fickly, and then they call for
the aid of that health which they cultivated and took
care of in their children.
The loſs of cheerfulneſs and good-humour com-
monly ſucceed the loſs of health; the old parents 10
uneaſy, and fret at all about them. And now is the
time for children to return that tenderneſs and pa-
tience to their parents' peeviſhneſs, without fourneſs
or reproof, which their parents had long lent then in
all their childiſh perverſeneſs, at an age when they
were not capable of being corrected.
In the next place, the old parents grow trouble-
ſomely talkative, and (as youth is too apt to think)
impertinent, and dwell eternally upon the obierva-
tions and adventures of their times and early years.
Remember, you alſo had your time of being talkative
and impertinent, and your parents bore with you;
but with this difierence, you aſked them filly and
trifling queſtions, and they now tell you wife and
uſeful obſervations. But they are troubleſoine, be-
cauſe they tell them too often. The anſwer to this
is very obvious; if your parents bore your folly,
you may well bear their wiſdom; and although per-
haps they talk more than is neceflary to inforın you
of preſent things, yet their converſation turns moſtly
upon things paſt, perhaps paft many years before you
came into the world, and confequently ſuch as they
muſt know a thouſand times better than you. Or
though they ſhould talk more than is neceflıry to in-
form you, they do not talk inore than is neceffary to
inform
your ſervants or your children, who are now
come to an age of alking many queſtions; and there-

fore Providence hath well appointed, that their
grandfather or their grandmother are now in an hu-
mour to anſwer them all, and to ſupply them with a
itore of uſeful obſervations which they want; nay,
which they want to hear over and over again, which
they want to have inculcated a thouſand times, and
which, without this affiſtance, would require a courſe
of years to acquire for themſelves. So that the hu-
mour of talkativeneſs, which is commonly thought
ſo troubleſome in old people, hath its uſe, and is
moſt excellently appointed by Almighty God. But
ſay it were not, the children, in bearing with it,
do but barely return their parents what they long
ſince owed them.
In the next place, the ſtrength of the old parents
fails them, and they cannot walk without a ſupport;
but ſure you will not let them want one! how many
years did they bear you in their arms ? how many
more did they lead you where you would be, and
ſaved you from falling and from danger? and will
you now ſuffer thoſe old limbs to totter and fall to the
earth, which ſo often ſupported and ſaved yours
when they were weak and tender, and unable to fup-
port and ſave themſelves ? certainly you will not,
you cannot at once be guilty of ſo much cruelty and
ingratitude. In the laſt place, the underſtanding of
the old parents begins to fail, and the ſtrength of
their minds doth not long outlive the itrength of their
bodies, but decays gradually till they become again
children; their teeth fall, and their tongues falter;
and they are once more infants, and are now con-
fined to their beds, as they were at firſt to their
cradles. This is the laſt ſtage of life; and here they
demand all that care, and compaſſion, and tender-
nefs at your hands, when they are juſt going out of
the world, which you called for at theirs when you
firit came into it,

A Letter to a Young Gentleman at School.
I
DEAR MASTER F.
AM glad to hear you are well fixt in your new
ſchool. I have now before me the three laſt let-
ters which you ſent your father, and, at his deſire,
am going to give you a few directions concerning let-
ter-writing, in hopes they may be of fome ſmall
ſervice toward improving your talent that way:
When
you
fit down to write, call off your thoughts
from every other thing but the ſubject you intend to
handle : conſider it with attention, place it in every
point of view, and examine it on every fide before
you begin. By this means you will lay a plan of it
in your mind, which will riſe like a well-contrived
building, beautiful, uniform, and regular : whereas,
if you neglect to form to yourſelf ſome inethod of
going through the whole, and leave it to be conducted
by giddy accident, your thoughts upon any ſubject
can never appear otherwiſe than as a mere heap of
confuſion. Conſider you are now to form a ſtyle, or,
in other words, to learn the way of expreſſing what
you think ; and your doing it well or ill for your
whole life, will depend, in a great meaſure, upon
the manner you fall into at the beginning. It is of
great conſequence, therefore, to te attentive and
diligent at firſt; as an expreſſive, genteel, and eaſy
manner of writing is ſo uſeful, ſo engaging a quality,
that whatever pains it coſts it amply will repay. Nor
is the taſk ſo difficult as you at firſt may think, a little
practice and attention will enable you to lay down
your thoughts in order; and I, from time to time,
will inſtruct and give you rules for ſo doing. But, on
your part, I ſhall expect obſervance and application,
without which nothing can be done.
As to the ſubjects, you are allowed in this way, the
utmoſt liberty. Whatſoever has been done, or thought,
or feen, or heard ; your obſervations on what you
know, your inquiries about what you do not know.;
the

the time, the place, the weather, every thing around
ſtands ready for your purpoſe ; and the more variety
you intermix, the better. Set diſcourſes require a
dignity or formality of ſtyle ſuitable to the ſubject;
whereas letter writing rejects all pomp of words, and
is moft agreeable when moſt familiar. But though
lofty phraſes are here improper, the ſtyle muſt not
therefore ſink into meannels : and, to prevent its doing
fo, an eaſy complaiſance, an open fincerity, and unaf-
fected good-nature, ſhould appear in every place. A
letter ſhould wear an honeſt, cheerful countenance,
like one who truly eſteems, and is glad to ſee his
friend; and not look like a fop admiring his own
dreſs, and ſeemingly pleaſed with nothing but himſelf.
Expreſs your meaning as briefly as poſſible; long
periods may pleaſe the ear, but they perplex the un-
derſtanding. Let your letters abound with thoughts
more than words. A ſhort ſtyle, and plain, flrikes
the mind, and fixes an impreſſion; a tedious one is
ſeldom clearly underſtood, and never long remem-
bered. But there is ſtill ſomething requitite beyond
all this, towards the writing a polite and agreeable
letter, fuch as a gentleman ought to be diſtinguiſhed
by; and that is, an air of good-breeding and huma-
nity, which ought conſtantly to appear in every ex-
preſſion, and give a beauty to the whole. By this I
would not be ſuppoſed to mean overſtrained or affected
compliments, or any thing that way tending ; but an
eaſy, genteel, and obliging manner of addreſs, a
choice of words which bear the moſt civil meaning,
and a generous and good-natured complaiſance.
What I have ſaid of the ſtyle of your letters, is
intended as a direction for your converſation alſo, of
which your care is neceſſary, as well as of your
writing. As the profeſſion allotted for you will re-
quire you to ſpeak in public, you ſhould be more
than ordinary ſolicitous how to expreſs yourſelf,
upon all occaſions, in a clear and proper manner, and
to acquire an habit of ranging your thoughts readily,
in apt and handſome terms; and not blunder out
your meaning, or be aſhamed to ſpeak it for want of
words,

words. Common converſation is not of fo little con-
ſequence as you may imagine ; and if you now ac-
cuſtom yourſelf to talk at random, you will find it
hereafter not eaſy to do otherwiſe.
I wiſh you good ſucceſs in all your ſtudies, and am
certain your capacity is equal to all your father's
hopes. Conſider, the advantage will be all your
own; and your friends can have no other ſhare of it,
but the ſatisfaction of ſeeing you a learned and a vir-

The Duty of endeavouring to obtain Wiſdom, and
the Uſe and Importance of it.
ISDOM is of itſelf delectable and ſatisfactory,
It is like light, pleaſant to behold, caſting
ſprightly luſtre, and diffuſing a benign influence all
about ; diſplaying objects in their due ſhapes, pof-
tures, magnitudes, and colours ; diſpelling the dark-
neſs of ignorance, fcattering the miſts of doubt, and
driving away the ſpectres of deluſive fancy; diſcover-
ing obſtacles, ſecuring the progreſs, and making the
paffages of life clear, open, and pleaſant. Wiſdom
begets in us a hope of ſucceſs in our actions, and is
uſually attended therewith. Now, what is more deli-
cious than hope? what more ſatisfactory than ſucceſs?
and he that aims at a good end, and knows he uſes
proper means to attain it, why ſhould he deſpair of
ſucceſs, fince effects naturally follow their cauſes, and
the Divine Providence is wont to afford his concur-
rence to ſuch proceedings ? Wiſdom makes all the
troubles, griefs, and pains incident to life, whether
caſual adverſities, or natural afflictions, eaſy and ſup-
portable, by rightly valuing the importance, and mo-
derating the influences of them. It ſuffers not buſy
fancy to alter the nature, amplify the degree, or ex-
ten the duration of them, by repreſenting them
more ſad, heavy, and remedileſs than they truly are.
Beſides that, it confers a felicity and dexterity in
action,

action, which is a very pleaſant and commodious
quality. To do things with difficulty and ſtruggling,
diſheartens a man, quells his courage, blunts the edge
of his reſolution, renders him fuggith and averſe
from buſineſs, though apprehended never ſo neceſſary
and of great moment. Theſe obſtructions Wiſdom
removes, facilitating operations, by directing the in-
tention to ends poffible and attainable, by ſuggeſting
fit means and inſtruments to work by, by contriving
right methods and courſes of proceſs; the mind by
it being ſtored with variety of good principles, ſure
rules, and happy expedients, repored in the me-
mory, and ready upon all occaſions to be produced
and employed in practice. Wiſdom tegets a found,
healthful, and harmonious complexion of the ſoul,
diſpofing us with judgment to diſtinguiſh, and with
pleaſure to reliſh lavory and wholeſome things, but
not to nauſeate and reject ſuch as are ungrateful and
noxious to us; whence to the foul proceeds all that
confort, joy, and vigour, which reſults to the body
from a good conſtitution and perfect health. Wile
dom acquaints us with ourſelves, our own temper
and
conftitution, our propenſions and paflions, our habitudes
and capacities ; a thing not only of mighty advantage,
but of infinite pleaſure and content to us. No man in
the world leſs knows a fool than himſelf. He hath
wonderful conceits of his own qualities and faculties;
he affects commendations incompetent to him, and
foars at employments furpaffing his ability to manage.
No comedy can repre!ent a miſtake more odd and
ridiculous than his; for what he wanders, ſtares, and
hunts after, but never can find or diſcern, is himſelf.
Wiſdom procures and preſerves a conttant favour and
fair reſpect of men, purchates a good name, and up-
holds reputation in the world ; which things are na-
turally deſirable, and commodious in life. The
compoſed frame of mind, uniform and comely de-
meanor, compliant and inoffenſive converſation, fair
and punctual dealing, confiderate motions and 'dex-
terous addreffes of wile men, naturally beget eſteem

and affection in thoſe that obſerve them : whereas
folly is freakiſh and humorous, impertinent and ob-
ſtreperous, inconſtant and inconſiſtent, peevith and
exceptious, and conſequently troubleſome to fociety,
and productive of averſion and diſreſpect. Wiſdoin
instructs us to examine, compare, and rightly to va-
lue the objects that court our affections, and challenge
our care; and thereby regulates our paſſions, and
moderates our endeavours, which begets a pleaſant
ſerenity, and peaceful tranquillity of inind. For
when, being deluded with falſe fhews, and relying
upon ill-grounded preſumptions, we highly elteem
and eagerly purſue things of little worth in thein-
ſelves, as we proſtitute our affections, miſ-ſpend our
time, and loſe our labour; ſo the event not anſwer-
ing our expectation, our minds thereby are con-
founded, diſturbed, and diſtempered. Wiſdoin dif-
covers our relations, duties, and concernments, in
reſpect of others with whom we converſe; diſtin-
guiſhes the circumſtances, limits the meaſures, deter-
mines the modes, appoints the fit feaſon of action ;
thus preferving decorum and order, the parents of
peace; and preventing confuſion, the mother of
iniquity, ſtrife, and diſquiet. In fine, Wiſdom ac-
quaints us with the nature and reaſon of true religion,
and perſuades us to the practice of it; teaches us
wherein it conſiſts, and what it requires, the miſtake
of which produceth daily ſo many miſchiefs in the
world. It news that it conliſteth not in fair pro-
feffions, but in real practice; not in a pertinacious
adherence to any ſector party, but in a fincere love
of goodneſs, and diſlike of naughtineſs, wherever dir-
covering itſelf; not in harſh centuring, and virulently
inveighing against others, but in carefully amending
our own ways; not in a vain oſtentation of ourward
performances, but in an inward goodneſs of mind,
exerting itſelf in works of true devotion and charity;
not in a nice orthodoxy, or politic ſubjection of our
judgments to the peremptory dictates of men, but in
a fincere love of truth, in a hearty approbation of and

A Letter from Mr. Pope to the Biſhop of Rocheſter.
O I
NCE more I write to you as I promiſed, and
will ſoon be drawn between my friend and me, and
nothing left but to wiſh you a long good-night. May
you enjoy a ſtate of repoſe in this life, not unlike that
ſleep of the ſoul which fome have believed is to ſuc-
ceed it, where we lie utterly forgetful of that world
from which we are gone, and ripening for that to
which we are to go. If you retain any memory of
the paſt, let it only imagine to you what has pleaſed

friend, or bring you back an agreeable converſation.
the whole, I hope you will think leſs of the
time paſt than of the future, as the former has been
leſs kind to you than the latter infallibly will be. Do
not envy the world your ſtudies; they will tend to the
benefit of men againſt whom you can have no complaint,
I mean of all poſterity; and perhaps at your time of
life nothing elſe is worthy your care. What is every
year of a wiſe man's life, but a cenſure or criticiſin
on the paſt? Thoſe whoſe date is the ſhorteſt, live
long enough to laugh at one half of it: the boy de-
ſpiſes the infant, the man the boy, the philoſopher
both, and the Chriſtian all. You may now begin to
think your manhood was too much a puerility, and
you will never ſuffer your age to be but a ſecond in-
tancy. The toys and baubles of
your
childhocd are
hardly now more below you, than thoſe toys of our
riper and of our declining years, the druins and rattles
of ambition, and the dirt and bubbles of avarice. At
this time, when you are cut off from a little fociety,
and made a citizen of the world at large, you ſhould
bend
your talents not to ſerve a party or a few, but
all mankind. Your genius ſhould mount above the

milt in which its participation and neighbourhood
with earth long involved it: to ſhine abroad to hea-
ven, ought to be the buſineſs and the glory of your
preſent ſituation. Remember it was at ſuch a time,
that the greateſt lights of antiquity dazzled and blazed
the moſt, in their retreat, in their exile, or in their
death. But why do I talk of dazzling or blazing'?
it was then that they did good, that they gave light,
and that they became guides to mankind.
Thofe aims alone are worthy of ſpirits truly great,
and ſuch I therefore hope will be yours. Reſentment
indeed may remain, perhaps cannot be quite extin-
guiſhed, in the nobleſt minds; but revenge never will
harbour there. Higher principles than thoſe of the
firſt, and better principles than thoſe of the latter, will
infallibly influence men whoſe thoughts and whoſe
hearts are enlarged, and cauſe them to prefer the
whole to any part of mankind, eſpecially to ſo fmall
a part as one's fingle ſelf.
Believe me, my Lord, I look upon you as a ſpirit
entered into another life, as one juſt upon the edge of
immortality, where the pallions and affections muſt
be much more exalted, and where you ought to de-
ſpiſe all little views and all mean retroſpects. No-
thing is worth your looking back; and therefore look
forward, and make (as you can) the world look after
you : but take care that it be not with pity, but with
eſteem and admiration.
I am with the greateſt fincerity, and paſſion for
your fame as well as happineſs.
Yours, &c.

lilly figure when he is dead. It ſeems to me great
pity that ſome people ſhould be ſo carele's about their
lives as they are; for, deſpicable as life is, a man,
when he has loít it, is not worth half what he was
when he had it. In ſhort, a dead king, a dead hero,

of thoſe

rites, Agrippa and Maecenas, honours and emolu-
ments fuitable to the dignity of the benefactor, and
to the ſervices of the receivers : nor has his conduct
been blamed. My employment about your Impe-
rial Majeſty has, indeed, been purely domeſtici I
have neither headed your armies nor aſſiſted at your
councils. But you know, Sir, (though there are
fomne who do not ſeem to attend to it) that a prince
may be ſerved in different ways, fome more, others
leſs conſpicuous, and that the latter may be, to him,
as valuable as the former.

Cæfar has given royally, as became imperial mag-
nificence. Seneca has received what his prince be-
ſtowed; nor did he ever aſk : he is only guilty of
not refuſing. Cæſar's rank places him above the reach
of invidious malignity: Seneca is not, nor can be,
high enough to deſpiſe the envious. As the over-
loaded ſoldier or traveller would be glad to be relieved
of his burden, fo I, in this laſt ſtage of the journey
of life, now that I find myſelf unequal to the lighteit

toils of government: his goodneſs will grant to his
worn-out ſervant leave to retire. It will not be de.
rogatory from Cæſar's greatneſs to have it ſaid, that

unanimity, ſobriety, and juſtice, that domeſtic ſedi-

bulwarks, have been often ſeen to yield to force
from without, or to tumults from within. An exact
military diſcipline, and a ſteady obfervance of civil
polity, are the fureſt barriers againſt theſe evils. But
there is itill another point of great importance to be

of theſe is in all refpects perfect, but each of them

Romulus was choſen King; and Rome was govern-
ed by Kings for upwards of 240 Years, until
the Expulſion of Tarquin II. which was occafion-

Wife of Collatinus, a noble Roman. Lucretin,
upon receiving this Injury, ſent for her Huſband,
who was then in the Comp at Ardea with Tar-
quin, and for ſeveral of his Friends, and having
informed them of the Outrage she had received,
and engaged them to revenge it, ftabbed herſelf
to the Heart, and died before them. The Roc
mans had long groaned under the Tyranny and
Cruelties of the Tarquins, and were therefore glad
to lay hold on ſo flagrant and outrageous an In-
ſult to ſhake off their Yoke. The famous Junius
Brutus, who for ſome Reafons had maſked; him-

That men with ſuch an example before our eyes,

tudie, fhall we, through a fear of dying, defer one
fin le inſtant to aſſert our liberty ? no, Romans ; now
is the time, the favourable moment we have ſo long
waited for his come. Tarquin is not at Rome. . The
patricians are at the head of the enterprize. The
city is abundantly provided wih men, arms, and all
things neceffary. There is nothing wanting to ſecure
the ſucceſs, if our own courage does not fail us. And
ſhall thoſe warriors, who have ever been ſo brave
when foreign enemies were to be fubdued, or when
conqueſts were to be made to gratify the ambition
and avarice of Tarquin, be then only cowards, when
they are to deliver themſelves from ſlavery ? Some of
you are perhaps intimidated by the army which Tar-
quin now commands. The ſoldiers, you imagine,
will take the part of their general. Baniſh fo ground-
leſs a fear: the love of liberty is natural to all men.
Your fellow-citizens in the camp feel the weight of

Rome: they will as eagerly ſeize the occaſion of
throwing off the yoke. But let us grant there may

or a bad education, will be diſpoſed to favour the ty-

we have means ſufficient in our hands to reduce them
to reaſon. They have left us hoſtages more dear to

fathers, their mothers, are here in the city. Cou-
rage, Romans, the gods are for us ; thoſe gods,
whoſe temples and altars the impious Tarquin has
profaned by ſacrifices and libations made with polluted
hands, polluted with blood, and with numberleſs un-
expiated crimes committed againſt his ſubjects. Ye
gods, who protected our forefathers, ye genii, who
watch for the prefervation and glory of Rome, do
you inſpire us with courage and unanimity in this
glorious cauſe, and we will to our laſt breath defend
your worſhip from all profanation.
After the Expulfion of the Tarquins, Rome was
governed by two Conſuls, who held their Office
during the Space only of a Year, at the Conclu-
fion of which new ones were choſen by the Senate
and People. After ſome Time, the People found
themſelves very
much oppresſed by the Patricians,
who engroſſed the full Power of the State, and
by various Extortions, ſuch as lending them Mo-
ney at exorbitant Intereſt, and the like, had got
Polefion of all their Lands, and often ſeized
their
Perſons, impriſoned, or uſed them as
Naves
(the Laws permitting it in caſe of the Non-pay-
ment of their Debts), in a bárbarous Manner.
Unable to bear this cruel Treatment, a Number
of them, at the Inſtigation of Sicinnius Bellutus,
and another Junius Brutus, took an opportu-
nity, when the State had great Need of their
Aliſtance, to deſert their Generals, and retired
to a Hill three Miles from Rome. In this Exi-
gence a Deputation was ſent to them from the
Senate, perſuading them, with many fair Pro-
miſes, to return. At the Head of this Deputa,
tion were T. Lartius, Menenius Agrippa, and
M. Valerius, all three in great Eſteem ; and of

they were introduced to the Camp of the Male-
contents, and had given an Account of their Com-
miſion, Junius Brutus, perceiving his Comrades
continued in a profound Silence, and that none of
them attempted to make himſelf an Advocate in
the Cauſe, ſtepped forward, and thus addreſſed
them :
O
NE would imagine, fellow-ſoldiers, by this deep
filence, that you are ſtill awed by that ſervile
fear in which the patricians and your creditors kept
you ſo long. Every man conſults the eyes of the reſt,
to diſcover whether there be more reſolution in others
than he finds in himſelf; and not one of you has the
courage to ſpeak in public, that which is the conſtant
ſubject of your private converſation. Do you not
know that you are free? this camp, theſe arms, do
not they convince you that you are no longer under
tyrants ? and if you could ſtill doubt it, would not
this ſtep which the ſenate has taken be ſufficient to
fatisfy you? thoſe patricians, fo haughty and impe-
rious, now ſend to court us; they no longer make
uſe either of proud commands or cruel threats; they
invite us as their fellow-citizens, to return into our
common city; nay, ſome of our ſovereigns, you fee,
are ſo gracious as to come to our very camp, to offer
us a general pardon. Whence then can proceed this
obſtinate ſilence, after ſuch fingular condeſcenſions ?
If you doubt the fincerity of their promiſes ; if you
fear that, under the veil of a few fine words, they
conceal your former chains, why do not you ſpeak?
declare your thoughts freely. Or, if you dare not
open your mouths, at leaſt hear a Roman, who has
courage enough to fear nothing but the not ſpeaking
the truth. [Then turning to Valerius] You invite
us to return to Rome, but you do not tell us upon
what conditions: Can plebeians, poor, though free,
think of being united with patricians, ſo rich and ſo
ambitious ? and even though we ſhould agree to the
conditions

conditions you have to offer, what ſecurity will the
patricians give us for the performance; thoſe haughty
patricians, who make it a merit among themſelves to
have deceived the people ? you talk to us of nothing
but pardon and foregiveneſs, as if we were your
ſub-
jects, and ſubjects in rebellion ; but that is the point
to be diſcuſfed. Is it the people or the ſenate who are
in fault? which of the two orders was it that firſt vio-
lated thoſe laws of ſociety, which ought to reign among
the members of the ſame republic? This is the queſ-
tion. In order to judge of this without prejudice,
give me leave barely to relate a certain number of
facts, for the truth of which I will appeal to no other
but yourſelf and your colleague. Our ſtate was found-
ed by kings, and never were the Roman people more
free and more ha py than under their government.
Tarquin himfelf, the laſt of thoſe princes, Tarquin,
ſo odious to the ſenate and the nobility, favoured
our intereſts as much as he oppoſed yours. Never-
theleſs, to revenge your wrongs, we drove that prince
from Rome; we took arms againſt a ſovereign, who
defended himſelf only with the prayers he made to
us to leave your intereſts, and to return to his obe-
dience. We afterwards cut to pieces the armies of
Veii and Tarquinii, which endeavoured to reſtore
him to the throne. The formidable power of Por-
fenna, the famine we underwent during a long fiege,
the fierce aſſaults, the continual battles, were all
theſe, or, in ſhort, was any thing capable of ſhaking
the faith which we had given you? Thirty Latin
cities united to reſtore the Tarquins. What would
you
have done then if we had abandoned you and
joined your enemies? what rewards might' we not
have obtained of Tarquin, while the fenate and no-
bles would have been the victims of his reſentment?
who was it that diſperſed this dangerous combination ?
To whom are you obliged for the defeat of the Latines?
Is it not to this people? Is it not to them you owe
that
very power
which
you
have ſince turned againſt
them? What recompence have we had for the affift-
ance we gave you? is the condition of the Roman

ties? on the contrary, have not our braveſt ſoldiers,
oppreſſed with the weight of uſury, been groaning in
the chains of their mercileſs creditors ? what has come
of all thoſe vain promiſes of aboliſhing, in time of
peace, the debts which the extortions of the great
had forced us to contract ? ſcarce was the war finiſhed,
but you alike forgot our ſervices and your oaths.
With what deſign then do you come hither? why
do you try to reduce this people by the enchantments
of your words ? are there any oaths ſo ſolemn as to
bind your faith? and after all, what would you get by
an union brought about by artifice, kept up with
mutual diſtruſt, and which muſt end at lait in a civil
war? let us on both ſides avoid ſuch heavy inisfor-
tunes, let us not loſe the happineſs of our ſeparation ;
ſuffer us to depart from a country where we are load-
ed with chains like fo inany ſlaves, and where, being
reduced to be only farmers of our own inheritances,
we are forced to cultivate them for the profit of our
tyrants. So long as we have our ſwords in our
hands, we ſhall be able to open ourſelves a way into
more fortunate climatesand wherever the gods
ſhall grant us to live in liberty, there ſhall we find
our country.
By this, and frequent Struggles of this Sort which
the People had made before, they at length attain-
ed the Eſtabliſhment of the Tribuneſnip, which
conſiſted of two Oficers annually chalen out of the
Oroler of the Plebeiaris, with Authority to pre-
vent the Injufiices that might be done to the
People, and to defend their Intereſts both public
and private. Rome, by this Eftabliſhment, made
a great Advance towards a new Change in the
Form of her Government. It had zeljed before
from the Monarchic State to a Kind of Ariſto-
cracy ;

cracy; for upon the Expulſion of Tarquin, tie
whole Authority did really and in fact devolve
upon the Senate and the Great : but now, by the
Creation of the Tribunes, a Democracy began to
take Place, and the People, by inſenſible Degrees,
and under different Pretences, got Polefion of,
the much greater Share in the Government. A
Famine which raged at Rome, foon after the
Eſtabliſhment of this Office, occaſions great Com-
plaints amongſt the People; and a large Supply
of Corn being procured from Sicily by the Patri-
cians, Coriolanus, a young Senator, who had done
great Services to the State as a General, is for
taking Advantage of the People's Diſtreſs, to get
the Tribuneſhip aloliſhed, which he propoſes in
the Senate. The Tribunes and the People, en-
raged at this, determine to proſecute Coriolanus,
and after much Altercation, deſire to be hard
by the Senate in relation to their Charge againſt
him; where Decius, one of the Tribunes, makes
the following Speech.
TOU know, Conſcript Fathers, that having by
our aſſiſtance expelled Tarquin, and aboliſhed
the regal power, you eſtabliſhed in the republic the
form of goverment which is now obſerved in it, and
of which we do not complain. But neither can you
be ignorant, that in all the differences which any
poor plebeians had afterwards with wealthy patricians,
thoſe plebcians conſtantly lost their cauſes, their ad-
verſaries being their judges, and all the tribunals be-
ing filled with patricians only. This abuſe was what
made Valerius Poplicola, that wile conſul and excel-
lent citizen, eſtabliſh the law which granted an appeal
to the people, from the decrees of the ſenate, and the
judgments of the confuls.
Such is the law called Valeria, which has always
been looked upon as the baſis and foundation of the
public liberty. It is to this law that we now fly for

redreſs, if you refuſe us the juſtice we demand upon a
man, black with the greateſt crime that it is poſſible to
commit in a republic. It is not a ſingle plebeian
complaining, it is the whole body of the Roman
people demanding the condemnation of a tyrant, who
would have destroyed his fellow-citizens by a famine,
has violated our magiſtracy, and forcibly repulſed our
officers, and the ediles of the commonwealth. Co-
riolanus is the man we accuſe of having propoſed the
abolition of the tribuneſhip, a magiſtracy made ſacred
by the moſt folemn oaths. What need is there of a
fenatus conſultum to profecute a criminal like this?

of the ſenate, are requiſite only in unforeſeen and ex-
traordinary affairs, and for which the laws have as
yet made no proviſion ? but in the preſent caſe, where
the law is ſo direct, where it expreſsly devotes to the
infernal gods, thoſe that infringe it, is it not to be-
come an accomplice in the crime to heſitate in the
leaſt? are you not apprehenſive that theſe affected
delays, this obſtruction you throw in the way of our
proceedings againſt this criminal, by the pretended
neceſſity of a previous decree of the fenate, will
make the people inclined to believe that Coriolanus
only ſpoke the ſentiments of you all ?
I know that ſeveral among you complain it was
merely by violence that we extorted your conſent for
the abolition of the debts, and the eſtabliſhment of
the tribuneſhip. I will even ſuppoſe that in the high
degree of power to which you had raiſed yourſelves
after the expulfion of Tarquin, it was neither conve-
nient nor honourable for you to yield up part of it in
favour of the people; but you have done it, and the
whole fenate is bound by the moſt folemn oaths never
to undo it.
After the eſtabliſhinent of thoſe facred
laws, which render the perſons of your tribunes in-
violable, will you, in compliance with the firit am-
bitious man that ariſes, attempt to revoke what makes
the ſecurity and peace of the ſtate? certainly you
never will; and I dare anſwer for you, ſo long as I
behold in this aſſembly thoſe venerable magiſtrates

who had ſo great a ſhare in the treaty made upon the
Mons Sacer. Ought you to ſuffer a matter like this
to be ſo much as brought into deliberation ? Coriola-
nus is the firſt, who, by his ſeditious advice, has en-
deavoured to break thoſe ſacred bonds, which,
Itrengthened by the laws, unite the ſeveral orders of
the Itate. It is he alone who is for deſtroying the
tribunitian power, the people's aſylum, the bulwark
of our liberty, and the pledge of our reunion. In
order to force the people's conſent, in order to perpe-
tuate one crime, he attempts another much greater.
He dares even in a holy place, and in the midſt of
the ſenate, propoſe to let the people die of hunger.
Cruel and unthinking man at the fame time! did he
not conſider that this people, whom he meant to
exterminate with fo much inhumanity, and who are
more numerous and powerful than he could wiſh, be-
ing reduced to deſpair, would have broken into the
houſes, forced open thoſe granaries, and thoſe cellars
which conceal ſo much wealth, and would rather have
fallen under the power of the patricians, or have to-
tally rooted out that whole order? could he imagine
that an enraged populace would in ſuch a caſe have
hearkened to any law but what was dictated by necef-
ſity and reſentment?
For that you may not be unacquainted with the
truth, we would not have periſhed by a famine brought
upon us by our enemies: but having called to witneſs
the gods, revengers of injuſtice, we would have filled
Rome with blood and ſlaughter. Such had been the
fatal conſequences of the counſels of that perfidious
citizen, if ſome ſenators, who had more love for their
country, had not hindered them from taking effect.
It is to you, Conſcript Fathers, that we addreſs our
juſt complaints. It is to your aid, and to the wiſdom
of your decrees, that we have recourſe to oblige this
public enemy to appear before the whole Roman
people, and anſwer for his pernicious counſels. It
is there, Coriolanus, that thou muſt defend thy for-
mer ſentiments, if thou dareſt ſo to do, or excuſe
them as proceeding from want of thought. Take my
advice;

When Decius left of ſpeaking, all the Senators
waited, fome with impatient Deſire, others with
uneaſy Apprehenſions, to hear how Appius Clau-
dius would declare himſelf. This Appius was
one of thoſe Patricians, who had always the moſt
violently oppoſed the Tribunitial Power.
firſt Eſtabliſhment he foretold the Senate, that they
were ſuffering a Tribunal to be ſet up, which, by
Degrees, would riſe againſt their Authority, and
at length deſtroy it. When it came to his Turn
to ſpeak he delivered himſelf thus :
TOU know, Conſcript Fathers, that I have long
oppoſed, and frequently alone, that too great
eatineſs with which you grant the people whatever
they demand. Perhaps I made myſelf troubleſome,
when I fo frankly laid before you the misfortunes
which I prefaged would follow, from our reunion with
the deſerters from the commonwealth. The event,
however, has but too well juſtified my apprehenſions.
That ſhare of power which you yielded up to thoſe
ſeditious men, is now turned againſt yourſelves. The
people puniſh you by means of your own benefactions ;
they take advantage of your favour to ruin your au-
thority. It is in vain for you to attempt to hide from
yourſelves the danger which the ſenate is in : you
cannot but ſee there is a deſign to change the form of
our government: the tribunes make gradual advances
to the tyranny. At firſt the only demand was the
abolition of the debts; and this people, who are now
ſo haughty, and who endeavour to make themſelves
the ſupreme judges of the ſenators, then thought they

ſtood in need of a pardon, for the diſreſpectful manner
in which they fued for that conceſſion.
Your eaſineſs gave occaſion to new pretenſions; the
people would have their particular magiſtrates. You
know how earneſtly I oppoſed theſe innovations ; but,
in ſpight of all I could do, you afſented in this point
alſo; you allowed the people to have tribunes, that is
to ſay, perpetual ring leaders of fedition. Nay, the
people, intoxicated with fury, would have this new
magiftracy confecrated in a particular manner, ſuch as
had never been practiſed, not even in favour of the
conſu!hip, the fift dignity in the republic. The fe-
nate conſented to every thing, not ſo much out of
kindrets for the people, as want of reſolution; the
perſons of the tribunes were declared ſacred and in-
violable, and a law made to that effect. The people
required that it ſhould be confirmed by the moſt ſo-
lemn oaths; and that day, O Fathers ! you ſwore upon
the altars the deſtruction of yourſelves and children.
What has been the fruit of all theſe favours ? they have
only ſerved to make you contemprible in the eyes of
the people, and to increaſe the pride and infolence of
their tribunes, who have made themſelves new rights
and prerogatives. Theſe modern magiſtrates, who
ought to live as mere private men, take upon them
to convene the aſienīblies of the people, and without
our privity procure laws to be enacted by the voices
of a bate rabble.
It is ſo odious a tribunal, that they now ſummon a
patrician, a fenator, a citizen of your order, in a
word, Coriolanus, that great captain, and withal that
good man, yet more illustrious for his adherence to
the intereſts of the lenate, than for his valour. They
preſume to make it a crime in a ſenator to ſpeak his
opinion in full ſenate, with that freedom ſo becoming
a Roman; and if yourſelves had not been his buckler
and defence, they' had afailinated him even in your
preſence. The inajeſty of the ſenate was just going
to be violated by this murder; the reſpect due to your
dignity was foi got, and you yourſelves were loſing
both your empire and your l.berty.

The reſolution and courage which you ſhewed upon
this laſt occaſion, in forme meaſure awakened the e
madmen from their drunken fit. They ſeem now to
be aſhamed of a crime which they could not complete ;
they defiſt from violent methods, becauſe they have
found them unſucceſsful, and they ſeemingly have
recourſe to juſtice and the rules of law.
But what is this juſtice, immortal gods! which
theſe men of blood would introduce ? they endea-
vour, by appearances of fubmiſſion, to ſurpriſe you
into a ſenatus conſultum, which may give them power
to drag the beſt citizen of Rome to puniſhment. They
alledge the lex Valeria as the rule of
your
conduct;
but does not every body know that this lavv, which
allows of appeals to the aſſembly of the people, re-
lates only to ſuch poor plebeians as, being deititute
of all other protection, might be opprefied by the cre.
dit of a ſtrong cabal ? the text of the law is plain ; it
expreſsly fays, that a citizen condemned by the con-
fuls ſhall have liberty to appeal to the people. Popli-
cola, by this law, only provided a refuge for thoſe
unhappy men, who had reafon to complain of hav-
ing been condemned by prejudiced judges. The de-
ſign of the law was only to have their cauſes heard
over again ; and when you afterwards conſented to
the creation of the tribunes, neither you, nor even
the people themſelves, intended any thing more in
the eſtabliſhment of thole new magiſtrates, than that
this law might have protectors, and the poor be pro-
vided with advocates, who might prevent their being
oppreſſed by the great.
What relation is there bea
tween ſuch a law, and the cauſe of a ſenator, a man
of an order ſuperior to the people, and who is ac-
countable for his conduct to none but the ſenate? to
ſhew that the lex Valeria relates only to plebeians ;
for about ſeventeen years that it has been made, let
Decius give me one fingle inſtance of a patrician called
in judgment before the people by that law, and our
difpute will be at an end. And indeed what juſtice
would there be in delivering up a ſenator to the fury
of the tribunes, and to luiter the people to be judges

in their own cauſe; as if their tumultuous aſſemblies,
directed by ſuch ſeditious magiſtrates, could be with-
out prejudice, without hatred, without pafſion ? thus,
O Fathers, it is my advice, that before you come to
any determination, you maturely conſider, that in this
affair your intereſts are inſeparable from thoſe of Co-
riolanus. As to the reſt, I am not for your revoking the
favours you have granted the people, by whatever
means they obtained them; but I cannot forbear ex-
horting you to refuſe boldly for the future whatever
they fhall endeavour to obtain of you contrary to
your own authority, and the form of our government.
The following Speeches are
of a different Kind
from
any of the foregoing. They are the Speeches of
two great Generals at the Head of their Armies
before an Engagement. It was at the Beginning
of the ſecond Punic War, that Hannibal the
Carthaginian General made that ſurpriſing March
over the Alps with his Army, and entered Italy.
He was met near the Banks of the Po by Pube
lius Scipio, with the Roman Army. The two
General's are ſaid to have conceived a high Opis
nion of each other. Hannibal's Name had been
long renowned; and that Scipio muſt be a Cap-
tain of eminent Worth, the Carthaginians had
well concluded, from the Romans having choſen
him, preferably to all others, to be bis Opponent.
But this mutual Impreſſion was become much
Atronger, by the hardy Enterpriſe of the one to
march over the Alps, and the happy Execution of
of it, and the expeditious Courage of the other
in coming from the Banks of the Rhone, to meet
him at the Foot of thoſe Mountains. But Scipio,
who was but newly appointed their General,

thought proper to aſemble his Soldiers before the*
Engagement, and endeavoured to animate their
Courage by the following Words:
W!
ERE you, ſoldiers, the ſame army which I
had with me in Gaul, I might well forbear
ſaying any thing to you at this time. For what oc-
caſion could there be to uſe exhortation to a cavalry,
that had ſo ſignally vanquiſhed the ſquadrons of the
enemy upon the Rhone, or to legions by whom that
fame enemy, flying before them to avoid a battle, did,
in effect, confeſs themſelves conquered ? but as theſe
troops, having been enrolled for Spain, are there with
my brother Cneius, making war under my auſpices
(as was the will of the fenate and people of Rome); I,
that you might have a conſul for your captain againſt
Hannibal and the Carthaginians, have freely offered
myſelf for this war. You then have a new general,
and I a new army. In this circumſtance a few words
from me to you will be neither improper nor unſea-
fonable. And that you may not be unappriſed of
what ſort of enemies you are going to encounter, or
of what is to be feared from them, they are the very
fame, whom, in a foriner war, you vanquiſhed both
by land and ſea; the fame from whom you took Si-
cily and Sardinia, and who have been theſe twenty
years your tributaries. You will not, I preſume,
march againſt theſe men with only that courage with
which
you are wont to face other enemies, but with
a certain anger and indignation, ſuch as you would
feel, if
you
flaves on a ſudden riſe up in
arms againſt you. Conquered and enſlaved, it is not
boldneſs but neceſſity that urges them to battle: un-
leſs you can believe that thoſe who avoided fighting
when their army was entire, have acquired better

river which runs into the Po, and is called the battle of the
Ticin. Scipio received a dangerous wound, and had been
left upon the place, if his ſon, a mere youth, (afterwards the
great Africanus) had not, by a ſurpriſing effort of courage,
brought him off. The Romans were obliged to retire.

in the paffage of the Alps.
But you heard perhaps, that, though they are few
in number, they are men of ſtout hearts and robuſt
bodies; heroes of ſuch ſtrength and vigour, as 110-
thing is able to reſiſt.- -Mere effigies ! nay, ſhadows
of men! wretches, emaciated with hunger, and be-
numbed with cold! bruiſed and battered to pieces
among the rocks and craggy cliffs ! their weapons
broke, and their horſes weak and foundered! Such
are the cavalry, and ſuch the infantry, with which
you are going to contend; not enemies, but the
fragments of enemies. There is nothing which I
more apprehend, than that it will be thought, Han-
nibal was vanquished by the Alps, before we had any
conflict with him. But perhaps it was fitting that to
it ſhould be; and that with a people and a leader,
who had violated leagues and covenants, the gods
themſelves, without man's help, ſhould begin the
war, and bring it to a near conclufion ; and that we,
who, next to the gods, have been injured and offend-
ed, ſhould happily finiſh what they have begun. I
need not be in any fear, that you ſhould ſuſpect me
of ſaying theſe things merely to encourage you,
while inwardly I have different ſentiments What
hindered me from going into Spain ? that was my
province; where I ſhould have had the leſs dreaded
Aſdrubal, not Hannibal to deal with. But hearing,
as I paſſed along the coaſt of Gaul, of this enemy's
march, I landed my troops, ſent the horſe forward,
and pitched my camp upon the Rhone. A part of
my cavalry encountered and defeated that of the ene-
my; my infantry not being able to overtake theirs,
which fled before us, I returned to my fleet, and
with all the expedition I could uſe in fo long a voyage
by ſea and land, am come to meet them at the foot
of the Alps. Was it then my inclination to avoid a

cules ; or whether he be what his father left him, a
tributary, a vaffal, a ſlave of the Rom.in people. Did
not the conſciouſneſs of his wicked deed at Saruntum
torment him and make him deſperate, he would have
ſome regard, if not to his conquered country, yet
furely to his own family, to his father's memory, to
the treaty written with Amilcar's own hand. We
might have ſtarved them in Eryx; we might have
paſſed into Africa with our victorious fleet, and in a
few days have deſtroyed Carthage. At their humble
fupplication we pardoned them; we releaſed them,
when they were cloſely ſhut up without a poſſibility
of eſcaping; we made peace with them when they
were conquered, when they were diſtreſſed by the
African war, we conſidered them, we treated 'them
as a people under our protection. And what is the
return they make us for all theſe favours ? under the
conduct of a hare-brained young man, they come
hither to overturn our ſtate, and lay waſte our coun-
try.--I could with, indeed, that it were not ſo; and
that the war we are now engaged in, concerned only
our own glory, and not our preſervation. But the
conteſt at preſent is not for the pofleffion of Sicily
and Sardinia, but of Italy itſelf. Nor is there be-
hind us another army, which, if we ſhould not prove
the conquerors, may make head against our victorious
enemies. There are no more Alps for them to paſs,
which might give us leiſure to raiſe new forces. No,
foldiers, here you muit make your ſtand, as if
just now before the walls of Rome. Let every one
reflect, that he is now to defend, not his own perſon
alone, but his wife, his children, his helpleſs infants.
Yet let not private conſiderations alone pofleſs our
minds ; let us remember that the eyes of the ſenate
and people of Rome are upon us, and that as our

Hannibal, on the other Side, maile Uſe of a new
Kind of Rhetoric to inſpire his Soldiers with Re-
folution. He gave Arms to ſeveral Mountaineers
whom he had taken Priſoners in his Paſſage over
the Alps, and propoſed to them to fight two and
two to the Death of one of them, in Sight of his
Army; promiſing Liberty and a complete Suit of
Armour, with a IVar Horſe, to ſuch of them as
came off vietorious. From the Yoy with which
the Priſoners accepted theſe Conditions, and the
Sentiments which Hannibal obſerved in his Troops
on beholding theſe Confiiets, he took Occaſion to
give them a more lively Image of their preſent Si-
tuation, which laid them under the abſolute Ne-
ceſſity of conquering or dying. His Speech was
to this Effect:
IN
F, in the eſtimation of your own fortune, you
will
but bear the ſame mind which you juſt now did, in
contemplating the fortune of others, the victory, tol-
diers, is ours. What
you
have ſeen, was not-a mere
fhew for amuſement, but a repreſentation of your own
real condition. I know not whether you or your
priſoners be encompaſſed by fortune with the ſtricter
bonds and neceſſities. Two ſeas incloſe you on the
right and left ;--not a ſhip to fly to for eſcaping.
Before
you
is the, Po, a river broader and more ra-
pid than the Rhone; behind you are the Alps, over
which, even when your numbers were undiminiſhed,
you were hardly able to force a paſſage. Here then,
ſoldiers, you muſt either conquer or die, the very
firſt hour you meet the enemy. But the ſame for-
tune which has thus laid you under the neceſſity of
fighting, has fet before your eyes thoſe rewards of vic-
tory, than which no men are ever wont to wiſh for

greater from the immortal gods. Should we by our
valour recover only Sicily and Sardinia, which were
raviſhed from our fathers, thoſe would be no incon-
fiderable prizes. Yet what are thoſe ? the wealth of
Rome, whatever riches ſhe has heaped together in the
ſpoils of nations, all thele, with the maſters of them,
will be yours. You have been long enough employ.
ei in drivin, the cutie up in the rait mountains of
Loufitania and Celtiberia ; you have hitherto met
with no reward worthy of the labours and dangers you
have undergone. The time is now come to re:ip the
full recompence
of
your toilfome marches over fo
many mountains and rivers, and through ſo many
nations, all of them in arms. This is the place ivhich
fortune has appointed to be the limits of your
la-
bours ; it is here that you will finiſh your glorious
warfare, and receive an ample recompence of your .
completed ſervice.
For I would not have you inti-
gine, that victory will be as difficult as the name of a
Roman war is great and founding. It has often hap-
pened that a deſpiſed enemy has given a bloody battle,
and the moſt renowned kings and nations have by a
ſmall force been overthrsan. And if you but take
away the glitter of the Roman name, what is there,
wherein they may ſtand in competition with you?
For (to ſay nothing of your ſervice in war for twenty
years together with ſo much valour and fuccels) froi
the very pillars of Hercules, from the oce:in, from
the utmoſt bounds of the earth, through ſo many
warlike nations of Spain and Gaul, are you not
come hither victorious? and with whom are you now
to fight? with raw foldiers, an undifciplined army,
beaten, vanquiſhed, befieged by the Gauls the very
laſt ſummer, an army unknown to their leader, and
unacquainted with him.
Or ſhall I, who was born, I might almoſt fay, but
certainly brought up, in the tent of iny father, that
moſt excellent general, ſhall I, the conqueror of
Spain and Gaul, and not only of the Alpine nations,

ſmall advantage, foldiers, that there is not one among
you, who has not often been an eye-witneſs of my
exploits in war; not one of whoſe valour I myſelf
have not been a ſpectator, ſo as to be able to name
the times and places of his noble atchievements; that

men, ſtrangers to one another.
On what fide foever I turn my eyes, I behold all
full of courage and ſtrength; a veteran infantry, a
moſt gallant cavalry ; you, my allies, moſt faithful
and valiant; you Carthaginians, whom not only your
country's caule, but the jufteſt anger impels to battle.
The hope, the courage of aflailants is always greater
than of thoſe who act upon the defenſive. With
hoſtile banners diſplayed, you are come down upon
Italy; you bring the war. Grief, injuries, indigni-
ties fire your minds, and ſpur you forward to re-

can vindicate with our ſwords. Come on then, be
men. The Romans
may with more ſafety be cowards;
they have their own country behind them, have places
of refuge to fly to, and are ſecure from danger in
the roads thither; but for you there is no middle
fortune between death and victory. Let this be but
well fixed in your minds, and once again, I ſay, you
are conquerors.
The two following Speeches are thoſe preceding the
Battle of Zama, which concluded the ſecond Pu-
nic War to the Advantage of the Romans, after
it had laſted ſeventeen Years. They are different
from the two former, as they relate to a Treaty
of Peace. The two Generals were Hannibal and
the famous Scipio Africanus, Son of the former
Scipio. An Interview was deſired by Hannibal,
and agreed to by Scipio. The Place pitched upon
was a large Plain between the twa Camps, en-
tirely open, and where no Ambuſh could be laid.
The two Generals rode thither, eſcorted by an
equal Number of Guardi; from whom ſeparat-
ing, and each attended only by an Interpreter,
they met in the Mid-way. Both remained for
a while ſilent, viewing each other with mutual
Admiration. Hannibal at length ſpoke thus.

the ſhores of Italy. The gods did not gire us that
mind. On Loth ſides we have leen ſo eager after
foreign pofleffions, as to put our own to the hazard
of war. Rome and Carthage have had, each in their
turn, the enemy at her gates. But fivce errors pait
may be more eaſily blam:d than corrected, let it now
be the work of you and me to put an erd, if poſſible,
to the oi ſtinate contention. For iny onn part, my
years, and the experience I have had of the inſtability
of fortune, inclines me to leave nothing to her de-
termination which reaſon can decide. But' much I
fear, Scipio, that your youth, your want of the like
experience, your uninterrupted ſucceſs, inay render
you averſe from the thoughts of peace. . He whom
fortune has never failed, rarely reflects upon her in-
conſtancy. Yet, without recurring to former exam-
ples, my own may perhaps fuſtice to teach you ino-
deration. I am that fame Hannibal who, after my
victory at Cannæ, became maſter of the greateit part
of your country, and deliberated with myſelf what
fate I ſhould decree to Italy and Rome. And now
ſee the change! here in Africa, I am come to treat
with a Roman for my cin preferration and my
country's. Such are the ſports of fortune. Is Me
then to be truſted becauſe ſhe ſmiles ? an advantage-
ous peace is preferable to the hope of victory. The
one is in your cwn power, the other at the pleaſure
of the gods. Should you prove victorious, it would
add little to your own glory, or the glory of your
country; if vanquiſhed, you loſe in one hour all the
honour and reputation you have been ſo many years
acquiring. But what is my aim in all this? That

Sicily, Sardinia, and all the iſlands between Italy, and
Africa. A peace on theſe conditions, will, in my
opinion, not only ſecure the future tranquillity of
Carthage, but be ſufficiently glorious for you, and
for the Roman name. And do not tell me that
fome of our citizens dealt fraudulently with you in
the late treaty : It is I, Hannibal, that now aſk a
peace; I aſk it, becauſe I think it expedient for iny

​The Anſwer of Scipio was to this Effect.
KNEW very well, Hannibal, that it was the hope
of your return which emboldened the Carthagi-
nians to break the truce with us, and to lay aſide all
thoughts of a peace, when it was juſt upon the point
of being concluded ; and your preſent propoſal is a
proof of it. You retrench from their conceſſions
every thing but what we are, and have been long
pofféffed of. But as it is your care that your
fellow-
citizens ſhould have the obligations to you of being
eaſed from a great part of their burthen, ſo it ought
to be mine th they draw no advantage from their
perfidiouſneſs. Nobody is more ſenſible than I am
of the weakneſs of man, and the power of fortune,
and that whatever we enterpriſe is ſubject to a thou-
ſand chances. If, before the Romans paffed into
Africa, you had of your own accord quitted Italy, and
made the offers you now make, I believe they would
not have been rejected. But as you have been forced
out of Italy, and we are maſters here of the open
country, the ſituation of things is much altered,
And, what is chiefly to be conſidered, the Cartha-
ginians, by the late treaty, which we entered into
at their requeſt, were, over and above what you
offer
to have reſtored to us, our priſoners without ranſom,
delivered up their ſhips of war, paid us five thouſand
talents, and to have given hoſtages for the performance
of all.' The ſenate accepted theſe conditions, but
Carthage failed on her part; Carthage deceived us.
What then is to be done? Are the Carthaginians to
be releaſed from the moſt important articles of the
treaty, as a reward of their breach of faith? No,
certainly. If, to the conditions before agreed upon,
you had added ſome new articles to our advantage,
there would have been matter of reference to the
Roman people; but when, inſtead of adding, you
retrench,

retrench, there is no room for deliberation. The
Carthaginians therefore muſt ſubmit to us at diſcre.
tion, or muſt vanquiſh us in battle.
N. B. The battle was fought, the Romans gained
the victory, and the Carthaginians ſubmitted to Rome.
This ended the ſecond Punic war, and acquired Sci-

The Picture of a Good Man.
E makes the intereſt of mankind, in a manner,
his own; and has a tender and affectionate con-
cern for their welfare. He cannot think himſelf hap-
py, whatever his poſſeſſions and enjoyments
are, while
he ſees others miſerable. His wealth and affluence de.
light him chiefly as the poor and indigent are the
better for it; and the greateſt charm of proſperity
is the opportunity it affords of relieving his fellow
creatures, and of being more extenſively uſeful.
He thinks he has diſcharged but the least part of his
duty, when he has done ſtrict juſtice to all; and there-
fore the communicating advice and comfort, aſſiſtance
and ſupport, according to the various exigencies of
thoſe with whom he converſes, is his conſtant endea-
vour, and moſt pleaſing entertainment. In the ſtrong
and elegant language of Job, “ He is eyes to the
66 blind, and feet to the lame; he delivereth the
poor
that
cry,
and the fatherleſs, and him that
“ hath none to help him; the bleſſing of him that
" is ready to periſh cometh upon him, and he cauſeth

may practiſe the more large and generous charity, he
retrenches uſeleſs pomp and extravagance; ard, by a
regular and prudent management, conſtantly pro-
vides for the relief of the neceſſitous ; etteeming this
a much more ſublime and noble gratification, than
the idle amuſements and gallantries of a vain and
luxurious age.

be uſeful; it is part of the ſtated employment and bu-
fineſs of his life. He contrives and ſtudies which way
he may be moſt ſerviceable to his fellow-creatures, and
what that particular talent is, with which he is in-
truſted for the good of mankind. If it be power, he
protects and encourages virtue by his authority and
influence, is the patron of liberty, and vindicates the
cauſe of oppreſſed innocence. If riches, he is rich
in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to com-
municate. If knowledge, he counts it his higheſt
pleaſure to instruct the ignorant, and adminiſter pro-
per direction and comfort in perplexing and difficult
circumſtances; and to defend the cauſe of religion,
and repreſent it in a juít and amiable light. And to
nothing of this does he want to be folicited, but his
generous heart is always ready, and ſtrongly difpofed
for beneficent deſigns and actions. You cannot lay a
greater obligation upon him, than by propoſing ways
in which he may be uſeful, or enlarge his ſphere of
uſefulneſs; for this is the point in which all his views,
all his ſatisfactions center.
Add to this, that he is inclined to abate of his right,
when inſiſting too ſtrictly upon it may have the ap-
pearance of harſhneſs and ſeverity ; and, as ſuch, a
îtrong ſenſe of benevolence, ſuch an exalted fpirit of
humanity and compaſſion, that no conſiderations of
private intereſt, no difference of nation or religious
profeſſion, can reſtrain; and which the greateſt in-
juries cannot bear down and extinguiſh. He aims
that his goodneſs may be as diffufive as poſlible, and
as much like that of the Univerſal Parent, the eter-
nal Fountain of Good, who ſupports, enlivens, and
recreates the whole creation; and therefore as he is
generous in all his deſigns, he is very fearful of dif-
obliging any, either by word or action; and endea-
vours, in his whole conduct, to be agreeable as well
as uſeful to all : being candid in his cenſures, prac-
tiſing to his inferiors the moſt endearing condeicen-
fion, and carefully avoiding moroſeneſs, and every
thing that has the appearance of inſolence or con-
teinpt. Finally, to conclude the ſketch of this moſt

unwearied in his endeavours to promote the happi-

cooled, though he meets with ungrateful returns ;

Part of the 15th Chapter of St. Luke.
A
ND Jeſus ſaid, A certain man had two ſons :
And the younger of them ſaid to his father, Fa.
ther, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.
And he divided unto them his living.
And not many days after, the younger fon gathered
all together, and took his journey into a far country,
and there waſted his ſubſtance with riotous living.
And when he had ſpent all, there aroſe a mighty
famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
And he went and joined himſelf to a citizen of that
country; and he ſent him into his fields to feed fwine.
And he would fain have filled his belly with the
huſks that the ſwine did eat : and no man gave unto
him.
And when he came to himſelf, he ſaid, how many
hired ſervants of my father's have bread enough and
to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger!
I will arife, and go to my father, and will ſay unto
him, father, I have finned againſt Heaven, and before
thee,
And am no more worthy to be called thy ſon, make
me as one of thy hired ſervants.
And he aroſe and came to his father. But when
he was yet a great way off, his father ſaw him, and
had compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and
kiſſed him.
And the ſon ſaid unto him, Father, I have finned
againſt Heaven, and in thy fight, and am no more
worthy to be called thy fon,

But the father ſaid to his ſervants, Bring forth the
beít robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his
hand, and ſhoes on his feet.
And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and
let us eat and be
merry.
For this my ſon was dead, and is alive again : he
was lott, and is found. And they began to be merry.
Now his elder fon was in the field: and as he came
and drew nigh to the houſe, he heard muſic and dan-
cing.
And he called one of the ſervants, and aſked what
theſe things meant.
And he faid unto him, Thy brother is come; and
thy father hath killed the fatted calf, becauſe he hath
received him ſafe and found.
And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore
came his father out, and entreated him.
And he anſwering, ſaid to his father, Lo, theſe
many years do I ſerve thee, neither tranſgreffed I at
any time thy commandinent, and yet thou never
gaveſt me a kid, that I might make merry with iny
friends :
But as ſoon as this thy fon was come, which hath
devoured thy living with harlots, thou haſt killed for
him the fatted calf.
And he ſaid unto him, Son, thou art ever with me,
and all that I have is thine.
It was meet that we ſhould make merry, and be
glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive

look
upon
me as your only friend and benefactor, and the cauſe
of all the comfort and pleafure that you enjoy : your
heart, I know, would be ready to break with grief, if
you thought this was the laſt day that I ſhould live
But, my child, though you now think yourſelf
mighty happy becauſe you have a hold of my hand,
you are now in the hands, and under the tender care
of a much greater father and friend than I am, whoſe
love to you is far greater than mine, and from whom
you receive ſuch bleſſings as no mortal can give.
That God whom you have ſeen me daily worſhip ;
whom I daily call upon to bleſs both you
and
me,
and
all mankind; whole wondrous acts are recorded in
thoſe Scriptures which you conſtantly read. That
God who created the heavens and the earth; who
brought a flood upon the old world; who ſaved Noah
in the ark; who was the God of Abraham, Iſaac,
and Jacob; whom Job bleſſed and praiſed in the
greateſt afflictions; who delivered the Iſraelites out of
the hands of the Egyptians; who was the protector
of righteous Joſeph, Moſes, Joſhua, and holy Da-
niel ; who ſent ſo many prophets into the world;
who ſent his ſon Jeſus Chriſt to redeem mankind.
This God, who has done all theſe great things; who
has created ſo many millions of men ; who lived and
died before you was born, with whom the ſpirits of
good men that are departed this life, now live; whom
infinite numbers of angels now worſhip in heaven.
This
great God, who is the creator of worlds, of an-
gels, and men, is your loving father and friend, your
good creator and nouriſher, from whom, and not from
me, you received your being ten years ago, at the
time that I planted that little tender elin which you
there ſee.
I myſelf am not half the age of this ſhady oak, uns

its boughs; we have all of us called it ours in our

You ſee, my ſon, this wide and large firmament
over our heads, where the ſun and moon, and all the
ſtars
appear in their turns. If you was to be carried
up to any of theſe bodies at this vaſt diſtance from us,
you would ſtill diſcover others as much above you,
as the ſtars that you ſee here are above the earth.
Were you to go up or down, eaſt or weſt, north or
ſouth, you will find the fame height without any top,
and the fame depth without any bottom.
And yet, my child, ſo great is God, that all theſe
bodies added together, are but as a grain of ſand in
his fight. And yet you are as much the care of this
great God and Father of all worlds, and all ſpirits, as
if he had no ſon but you, or there were no creature
for him to love and protect but you alone. He num-
bers the hairs of your head, watches over you ſleep-
ing and waking, and has preſerved you from a thou-
fand dangers, which neither you nor I know any
thing of.
How poor my power is, and how little I am able
to do for you, you have often ſeen. Your late fick-
neſs has ſhewn you how little I could do for you in
that ſtate ; and the frequent pains of your head are
plain proofs that I have no power to remove them.
I can bring you food and medicines, but have no
power to turn them into your relief and nouriſhment;
it is God alone that can do this for you.
Therefore, my child, fear, and worſhip, and love
God. Your eyes indeed cannot yet ſee him, but
every thing you ſee are ſo many marks of his power
and preſence, and he is nearer to you than any thing
that
Take him for your lord, and father, and friend ;
look up unto him as the fountain and cauſe of all the
good that you have received through my hands; and
reverence me only as the bearer and miniſter of God's
good things unto you; and he that bleſſed my
father
before I was born, will bleſs you when I am dead.

But, my child, you belong to a greater family than
mine; you are a younger member of the family of
this Almighty Father of all nations, who has created
infinite orders of angels, and numberleſs generations
of men, to be fellow-members of one and the ſame
ſociety in heave
You do well to reverence my authority, becauſe
God has given me power over you, to bring you up
in his fear, and to do for you as the holy fathers re-
corded in Scripture did for their children, who are
now in reſt and peace with God.
I ſhall in a ſhort time die, and leave you to God and
yourſelf; and if God forgiveth my fins, I ſhall go to
his ſon Jeſus Christ, and live amongst patriarchs and
prophets, faints and martyrs, where I ſhall pray for
you, and hope for your ſafe arrival at the ſame place.
Therefore, my child, meditate on theſe great things,
and your ſoul will foon grow great and noble by fo me-
ditating upon them.
Let your thoughts often leave theſe gardens, theſe
fields and farms, to contemplate upon God and hea-
ven, to conſider angels, and the fpirits of good men
living in light and glory.
As you have been uſed to look to me in all your ac-
tions, and have been afraid to do any thing, unleſs
you firſt knew my will; ſo let it now be a rule of
your life to look up to God in all your actions, to do
every thing in his fear, and to abſtain from every
thing that is not according to his will.
Bear him always in your mind; teach your thoughts
to reverence him in every place; for there is no place
where he is not.
God keepeth a book of life, wherein all the actions
of all men are written : your name is there, my child,
and when you die, this book will be laid open before
men and angels ; and according as your actions are
there found, you will either be received to the happi-
neſs of thoſe holy men who have died before you, or
be turned away amongſt wicked ſpirits, that are never
to ſee God any more.

it muſt be opened, you muſt ſee it, and you muſt be
tried by it. Strive therefore to fill it with your good
deeds, that the hand-writing of God may not appear
againſt you.
God, my child, is all love, and wiſdom, and good-
neſs; and every thing that he has made, and every ac-
tion th does, is the effect of em all. There.
fore you cannot pleaſe God, but fo far as you ſtrive
to walk in love, wiſdom, and goodneſs. As all wif-
dom, love, and goodneſs proceeds from God; fo no-
thing but love, wiſdom, and goodneſs can lead to God.
When
you
love that which God loves, you act with
him, you join yourſelf to him ; and when you love
what he diſlikes, then you oppoſe him, and ſeparate
yourſelf from him. This is the true and the right
way; think what God loves, and do you love it with
all your heart.
Firſt of all, my child, worſhip and adore God,
think of him magnificently, ſpeak of him reverently,
magnify his providence, adore his power, frequent
his ſervice, and pray unto him conſtantly.
Next to this, love your neighbour, which is all
mankind, with ſuch tenderneſs and affection as you
love yourfelf. Think how God loves all mankind,
how merciful he is to them, how tender he is of them,
how carefully he preſerves them, and then ſtrive to
love the world as God loves it.
God would have all men to be happy, therefore
do you will and deſire the fame.
All men are great
inſtances of divine love, therefore let all men be
inſtances of your love.
Let the only motive to all your good actions be to
do every thing in as perfect a manner as you can; for
this only reaſon, becauſe it is pleaſing to God, who
writes all your actions in a book. When I am dead,
my ſon, you will be maſter of all my eſtate, which
will be a great deal more than the neceſſities of one
family require. Therefore as you are to be chari-
table to the fouls of men, and wiſh them the ſame

their bodies, and endeavour to make them as happy as
you upon earth.
As God has created all things for the common good
of all men; ſo let that part of them, which is fallen
to your ſhare, be employed, as God would have all
employed, for the common good of all.
Do good, my ſon, firſt of all to thoſe that moſt de.
ſerve it, but remember to do good to all. The greateſt
finners receive daily inſtances of God's goodneſs to-
wards them; he nouriſhes and preſerves them, that
they may repent, and return to him; do you therefore
imitate God, and think no one too bad to receive
your relief and kindneſs, when you ſee that he wants it.
I am teaching you Latin and Greek, that at pro-
per times you may look into the hiſtory of paft ages,
and learn the methods of God's providence over the
world: that reading the writings of the ancient ſages,
you may ſee how wiſdom and virtue have been the
praiſe of great men of all ages, and fortify your mind
by their wiſe ſayings.
Let truth and plainneſs therefore be the only orna-
ment of your language, and itudy nothing but how to
think of all things as they deſerve, to choofe every
thing that is beſt, to live according to reaſon and or-
der, and to act in every part of your life in conformity
to the will of God.
Study how to fill your heart full of the love of God
and the love of your neighbour, and then be content
to be no dee per a ſcholar, no finer a gentleman, than
theſe tempers will make you. As true religion is no-
thing elſe but ſimple nature governed by right reaſon;
ſo it loves and requires great plainneſs and ſimplicity
of life. Therefore avoid all ſuperfluous ſhews, finery,
and equipage, and let your houſe be plainly furniſhed
with inoderate conveniences. Do not conſider what
your eſtate can afford, but what right reaſon requires.
Let your dreſs be ſober, clean, and modeit; not
to ſet out the beauty of your perſon, but to declare
the fobriety of your mind, that your outward garb
may reſemble the plainneſs of your heart. For it is

As to your meat and drink, in them obſerve the

But, my ſon, obſerve this, as a moſt principal thing
which I ſhall remember you of as long as I live.
Hate and deſpiſe all human glory, for it is nothing
elſe but human folly. It is the greateſt ſnare, and the
greateſt betrayer that you can poſſibly admit into your
heart.
Let every day therefore be a day of humility, con-
deſcend to all the weakneſs and infirmities of your
fellow-creatures, cover their frailties, love their ex-
cellences, encourage their virtues, relieve their wants,
rejoice in their proſperities, compaſſionate their dir-
treſs, receive their friendſhip, overlook their unkind-
neſs, forgive their malice, be a ſervant of ſervants,
and condeſcend to do the loweſt offices to the loweſt of
mankind.
Aſpire after nothing but your own purity and per-
fection, and have no ambition but to do every thing
in ſo reaſonable and religious a manner, that you may
be glad that God is every where preſent, and fees all
your actions. The greateſt trial of humility, is an
humble behaviour towards your equals in age, eſtate,
and conditions of life. Therefore be careful of all
the motions of your heart towards theſe people. Let
all your behaviour towards them be governed by un-
feigned love. Have no deſire to put any of your
equals below you, nor any anger at thoſe that would
put themſelves above you. If they are proud, they
are ill of a very bad diſtemper; let them therefore
have your tender pity, and perhaps your meekneſs
may prove an occaſion of their cure; but if your hu-
mility ſhould do them no good, it will however be the
greateſt good to yourſelf.

HOUGH I ſpeak with the tongues of men and
of angels, and have not charity, I am become
as founding braſs, or a tinkling cymbal
.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and un.
derſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge, and though
I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing.
And though I beſtow all my goods to feed the
poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind; Charity en-
vieth not; Charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up,
Doth not behave itſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her
own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil,
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth:
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
things, endureth all things.
Charity never faileth : but whether there be
pro-
phecies, they ſhall fail; whether there be tongues,
they ſhall ceaſe ; whether there be knowledge, it ſhall
vaniſh away.
For we know part, and we prophecy in part.
But when that which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part ſhall be done away.
When I was a child, I ſpake as a child, I under-
ſtood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I

And if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching

Yea, and we are found falſe witneſſes of God; be.

For if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed :
And if Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain; ye

Then they alſo which are fallen alleep in Chriſt are

If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are

But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become

For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo

even fo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.
But every man in his own order: Chriſt the first
fruits, afterward, they that are Chriſt's at his coming.
Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have deliver-
ed the kingdom to God, even the Father; when
he ſhall have pat down all rule, and all authority, and

All fleſh is not the ſame fleſh: but there is kind

There are alſo celeſtial bodies, and bodies terreſtrial:
but the glory of the celeſtial is one, and the glory of
the terreſtrial is another.
There is one glory of the ſun, and another glory of

It is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in. glory : it is
fown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power:
It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual
body. There is a natural body, and there is a pritual
body.
And ſo it is written, The firſt man Adam was made
a living foul, the laſt Adam was made a quickening
ſpirit.
Howbeit, that was not firſt which is ſpiritu.il, but
that which is natural; and afterward that which is
fpi ritual.
The firſt man is of the earth, earthy : the ſecond
man is the Lord from heaven.
As is the earthy, ſuch are they alſo that are earthy :
and as is the heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are
heavenly.
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we
ſhall alſo bear the image of the heavenly.
Now this I ſay, brethren, that fleſh and blood can-
not inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth cor-
ruption inherit incorruption.
Behold I ſhew you a myſtery : we ſhall not all
Peep, but we ſhall all be changed,
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
laſt rump (for the trumpet ſhall found), and the dead
ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed.
For this corruptible inuſt put on incorruption, and
this mortal muit put on immortality.
So when this corruptible ſhall have put on incor-
ruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immorta-
lity, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is
written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory.
O death! where is thy fting? O grave ! where is
thy victory?
The ſting of death is ſin; and the ſtrength of fin
is the law.
But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory,
through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt,
unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the

Compariſon between Chriſtianity and Maho-
metaniſm.
HE Goſpel had no competitor, till the great and
pretends a commiſſion to all the world, and found
means fufficiently to publiſh his pretences : he afferts
his authority upon the ſtrength of Revelation, and
endeavours to transfer the advantages of the Goſpel
evidence to himſelf, having that pattern before him
to copy after: and ſhould we ſay that the Alcoran
was never promulged to us by perſons duly commif-
fioned, it may be anſwered perhaps, that the Alco-
ran is as well publiſhed to us as the Goſpel is to them;
which has ſome appearance of an anſwer, though
the fact is indeed otherwiſe ; for even the Alcoran
owns Jeſus for a true prophet.
But, with reſpect to this inſtance, I perſuade my-
feif it can be no very diſtracting ſtudy to find reaſons

he ſet in flames, the countries which he ravaged and
deitroyed, and the miſerable diſtreſs of all the inha-
bitants of the earth. When ſhe has viewed him in
this ſcene, carry her into his retirements : ſhew her
the prophet's chamber, his concubines, and his wives;
let her ſee his adultery, and hear him alledge reve-
lation and divine commiſſion to juſtify his luſt and his
oppreffion. When ſhe is tired with this proſpect, then
thew her the bleſſed Jeſus humble and meek, doing
good to all the fons of men, patiently inſtructing both
the ignorant and the perverle. Let her ſee him in
his moſt retired privacies : let her follow him to the
mount, and hear his devotions and ſupplications to
God.

On Converſation.
Son
OCIETY ſubſiſts amongſt men by a mutual com
munication of their thoughts to each other.
Words, looks, geſture, and different tones of voice,
are the means of that communication. I ſpeak, and
in an inſtant my ideas and ſentiments are communi.
cated to the perſon who hears me; my whole foul in
a manner paſſes into his. This communication of
my thoughts is again the occaſion of others in him,
which he communicates to me in his turn. Hence
ariſes one of the moſt lively of our pleaſures ; by this
means too we enlarge our knowledge, and this reci.
procal commerce is the principal ſource of our intel-
lectual wealth,
The firſt rule with regard to Converſation, is to ob-
ſerve all the laws of politeneſs in it. This rule is of
all others the moſt indiſpenfible It is not in every
one's power perhaps to have fine parts, fay witty things,
or tell a ttory agreeably; but every man may be po-
lite, if he pleales, at leaſt to a certain degree. Po-
liteneſs has infinitely more power to make a perſon
be loved, and his company fought after, than the

vanity may
moſt extraordinary parts or attainments he can be
maſter of. Theſe ſcarce ever fail of exciting envy,
and
envy has always fome ill-will in it. If
you
would
be eſteemed, make yourſelf be loved; we always
eſteem the perſon we love more than he deferves,
and the perſon we do not love, as little as ever we
can; nay, we do all we can to deſpiſe him, and com-
monly ſucceed in it.
Great talents for Converſation require to be accom-
panied with great politeneſs; he who eclipſes others
owes them great civilities; and whatever a miſtaken
tell
us, it is better to pleaſe in Converſa-
tion than to ſhine in it.
Another general rule in Converſation is, to con-
form yourſelf to the taſte, character, and preſent hu-
mour of the perſons you converſe with. This rule
is a conſequence of the foregoing; politeneſs dictates
it, but it requires a large fund of good-nature and
complaiſance to obſerve it; not but that a perſon
muſt follow his talent in Converſation ; do not force
nature, no one ever did it with ſucceſs. If you have
not a talent for 'humour, or raillery, or ſtory-telling,
never attempt them. Contain yourſelf alſo within
the bounds of what you know, and never talk upon
things you are ignorant of, unleſs it be with a view
to inform yourſelf. A perſon cannot fail in the ob-
ſervance of this rule, without making himſelf ridicu-
lous ; and yet how often do we ſee it tranfgrefied !
fome, who on war or politics could talk very well,
will be perpetually haranguing on works of genius
and the belles lettres; others, who are capable of
reaſoning, and would make a figure in grave diſcourſe,
will yet conſtantly aim at humour and pleaſantry,
though with the worſt grace imaginable. Hence it
is, that we ſee a man of merit ſometimes appear like
a coxcomb, and hear a man of genius talk like a fool.
Avoid diſputes as much as poſſible. In order to
appear eaſy and well-bred in converſation, you may
affure yourſelf it requires more wit, as well as more
good humour, to improve, than to contradict the
notions of another; but if you are at any time obliged

way
to enter on an argument, give your reaſons with the
utmoſt coolneſs and modeſty, two things which ſearce
ever fail of making an inpreſſion on the hearers.
Beſides, if you are neither dogmatical, nor ſhew either
by your actions or words that you are full of yourſelf,
all will the more heartily rejoice at your victory;
nay, ſhould you be pinched in your argument, you
may
make your retreat with a very good grace; you
were never poſitive, and are now glad to be better in-
formed. This has made fome approve the Socratical
of reaſoning, where, while you ſcarce affirm any
thing, you can hardly be caught in an abſurdity;
and though pollibly you are endeavouring to bring
over another to your opinion, which is firnaly fixed,
you ſeem only to deſire information froin him.
In order to keep that temper which is ſo difficult,
and yet ſo necetary to preferve, you may pleaſe to
conſider, that nothing can be more unjuſt or ridiculous,
than to be angry with another, becauſe he is not of
your opinion. The intereſt, education, and means
by which men attain their knowledge, are fo very
different, that it is impoſſible they ſhould all think
alike, and he has at leaſt as much reafon to be angry
with you, as you with him. Sometimes, to keep
yourſelf cool, it may be of ſervice to aſk yourſelf
fairly, what might have been your opinion, had you
all the biaſſes of education and intereſt your adverſary
may poſſibly have? but if you contend for the honour
of victory alone, you may lay down this as an infal-
lible maxim, that you cannot make a more falſe ſtep,
or give your antagonist a greater advantage over you,
than by falling into a paſſion.
When an argument is over, how many weighty
reaſons does a man recollect, which his heat and vio-
lence made him utterly forget?
It is yet more abfurd to be angry with a man becauſe
he does not apprehend the force of your reaſons, or
gives weak ones of his own. If you argue for repu-,
tation, this makes your victory the eaſier; he is cer-
tainly in all reſpects an object of your pity, rather
than anger, and if he cannot comprehend what you
do,

do, you ought to thank nature for her favours, who
has given you ſo much the clearer underſtanding,
You may pleaſe to add this conſideration, that
among your equals no one values your anger, which
only preys upon its maſter; and perhaps you may
find it not very conſiſtent either with prudence or
your eaſe, to puniſh yourſelf whenever you meet
with a fool or a knave.
Laſtly, If you propoſe to yourſelf the true end of
argument, which is information, it may be a ſeaſon-
able check to your paſſion ; for if you ſearch purely
after truth, it will be almoſt indifferent to you where
you find it. I cannot in this place omit an obſerva-
tion which I have often made, namely, that nothing
procures a more eſteem and leſs
envy
from
the whole company, than if he chooſes the part of
moderator, without engaging directly on either ſide
in a diſpute. This gives him the character of impar-
tial, furniſhes him with an opportunity of fifting
things to the bottom, of ſhewing his judgment, and
of ſometimes making handſome compliments to each
of the contending parties. I ſhall cloſe this ſubject
with giving you one caution: when you have gained
a victory, do not puſh it too far; it is ſufficient to let
the company and your adverſary ſee it is in your
power, but that you are too generous to make uſe
of it.

The Converſation of moſt men is diſagreeable, not
ſo much for want of wit and learning, as of good-
breeding and diſcretion.
If you reſolve to pleaſe, never ſpeak to gratify any
particular vanity or paffion of your own, but always
with a deſign either to divert or inform the company:
A man who only aims at one of theſe, is always eaſy
in his diſcourſe: he is never out of humour at being
interrupted, becauſe he conſiders that thoſe who hear
him are the beſt judges, whether what he was ſaying
could either divert or inform them.
A modeſt perſon felcom fails to gain the goodwill
of thoſe he converſes with ; becauſe nobody envies a
man who does not appear to be pleaſed with himſelf.
We ſhould talk extremely little of ourſelves. In-
deed what can we ſay? it would be as imprudent to
diſcover our faults, as ridiculous to count over our
fancied virtues. Our private and domeſtic affairs are
no leſs improper to be introduced into Converſation.
What does it concern the company
how
many
horſes
you keep in your itables? or whether your ſervant is
inoit knave or fool ? a man may equally affront the
company he is in, by engroſſing all the talk, or ob-
ſerving a contemptuous filence.
Before you tell a ſtory, it may be generally not
amils to draw a ſhort character, and give the compa- :
ny a true idea of the principal perſons concerned in
it; the beauty of moſt things conſiſting not fo much
in their being ſaid or done, as in their being ſaid
or done by ſuch a particular perſon, or on ſuch a parti-
cular occaſion.
Notwithſtanding all the advantages of youth, few
young people pleaſe in Converſation; the reaſon is,
that want of experience makes them pofitive, and
what they ſay is rather with a deſign to pleaſe them-
ſelves than any one elſe.
It is certain, that age itſelf ſhall make many things
paſs well enough, which would have been laughed at
in the mouth of one much younger.
Nothing, however, is more inſupportable to men
of fenfe, than an empty formal man, who ſpeaks in
proverbs,
1

proverbs, and decides all controverſies with a ſhort
ſentence. This piece of ſtupidity is the more inſuf-
ferable, as it puts on the air of wiſdom.
A prudent man will avoid talking inuch of any par-
ticular ſcience for which he is remarkably famous.
There is not, methinks, an handſomer thing faid of
Mr. Cowley in his whole life, than that none but
his intimate friends ever diſcovered he was a great
poet by his diſcourſe. Beſides the decency of this
rule, it is certainly founded in good policy. A man
who talks of any thing he is already famous for, has
little to get, but a great deal to loſe. I might add,
that he who is ſometimes filent on a ſubject where
every one is fatisfied he could ſpeak well, will often
be thought no leſs knowing in other matters, where
perhaps he is wholly ignorant.
Whenever you commend, add your reaſons for do-
ing ſo; it is this which diſtinguiſhes the approbation
of a man of ſenſe from the flattery of fycophants, and
admiration of fools.
Raillery is no longer agreeable than while the
whole company is pleaſed with it. I would leaſt of
all be underſtood to except the perfon rallied.
Though good-humour, fenfe, and diſcretion, fel-
doin fail to inake a man agreeable, it may be no ill
policy fonetimes to prepare yourſelf in a particular
manner for Converſation, by looking a little farther
than your neighbours into whatever is become a
reigning ſubject
. If our armies are belieging a place
of importance abroad, or our houſe of commons de-
bating a bill of conſequence at home, you can hardly
fail of being heard with pleaſure, if you have nicely
informed yourſelf of the ſtrength, ſituation, and hiſ-
tory of the firſt, or of the reaſons for and againſt the
latter. It will have the ſame effect, if when any ſingle
perſon begins to make a noiſe in the world, you can
learn ſome of the ſmalleſt accidents in his life or con-
verſation, which, though they are too fine for the
obſervation of the vulgar, give more ſatisfaction to
men of ſenſe (as they are the beſt opening to a real
character), than the recital of his moſt glaring actions.

I know but one ill conſequence to be feared from this
method, namely, that coming full-charged into
company, you ſhould reſolve to unload, whether
an handſome opportunity offers itſelf or no.
Though the aſking of queſtions may plead for itſelf
the fpecious name of modeſty, and a deſire of infor-
mation, it affords little pleature to the reſt of the
company who are not troubled with the ſame doubts;
beſides which, he whio alks a queſtion would do well
to conſider, that he lies wholly at the mercy of another
before he receives an anfwer.
Nothing is more filly than the pleaſure ſome people
take in what they call ſpeaking their minds. A man
of this make will ſay a rude thing for the mere plea-
fure of ſaying it ; when an opposite behaviour, full as
innocent, might have preſerved his friend, or made
his fortune.
It is not impoſſible for a man to form to himſelf as
exquifite a pleaſure in complying with the humour and
ſentiments of others, as of bringing others over to
his own; ſince it is the certain ſign of a ſuperior
genius, that can take and become whatever dreſs it
pleaſes.
I Mall only add, that beſides what I have here faid,
there is ſomething that can never be learnt, but in the
company of the polite. The virtues of men are
catching as well as their vices, and your own obſerva-
tions added to theſe, will ſoon diſcover what it is that
commands attention in one man, and makes you tired
and diſpleaſed with the diſcourſe of another.

thought; religion ſhall then be reſtored, liberty afa
ſerted, and parliaments have thoſe privileges they
have fought for : we ſhall then hope, that other laws
will have place beſides thoſe of the ſword, and that
juſtice ſhall be otherways defined, than the will and
pleaſure of the ſtrongeſt; and we ſhall then hope,
men will keep oaths again, and not have the neceflity
of being falle and perfidious, to preſerve themſelves,
and be like their rulers: all this we hope from your
Highneſs's happy expiration, who are the true father
of your country; for, while you live, we can call
nothing ours, and it is from your death that we hope
for our inheritances : let this conſideration arm and

Extract from Gordon's Dedication of his Tranſ-
lation of Salluft.
A
HERO without heroiſm, can only be created
by flatterers without ſhame: a king void of
faith, can paſs for a hero with none but fycophants
void of conſcience. Praiſe not merited, but bought,
rarely lives ſo long as the buyer, even though he be
conſtantly buying: if it be ingenious praiſe, it will
rather be the portion of the ſeller; at all events, it will
be for ever ftained with the reproach of being ſold.
The worthleſs dead, as they could not expect, nei-
ther can they bear remembrance. True worth gains
by the grave. The good which they did, is remem-
bered: the little and great falfities raiſed about them,
are forgotten ; perſonal envy ceaſes; the clamour of
party is heard no more: juſtice is reſtored, truth pre-
vails, and that virtute which ſtands in no man's way,
is by all men applauded.
After death, characters are better known. The
good ſtand the teſt of pofterity. The great and vir-
tuous continue to be loved and praiſed. The great
and bad are hated and blaſted. Nero and Meffalina
are names of reproach and horror, at the end of
ſeventeen hundred years : Scipio and Portia are names
ſtill celebrated, at a greater diſtance of time. They
themſelves indeed feel neither obloquy nor praiſe :
but they will ever live in record, and reap eternal
renown, or eternal infamy.
Compariſon between Cato and Cæfar.

endeavoured to recal ancient probíty and innocence;
to reclaim or puniſh evil-doers; to ſecure the public
by upright meaſures ; and to tranſmit liberty and
good government to generations to come: Cæfar pro-
moted diffoluteneſs and venality ; encouraged public
criminals; embroiled, and debauched, and oppreffed
the ſtate. Cato loved his country, fought for it, and
died for it; and thence left to it an illuſtrious and affect-
ing example, of virtue incorruptible, and of primi-
tive zeal: Cæfar loved himſelf beyond his country,
fought for himſelf againſt his country, and to himſelf
enſlaved his country: he entailed bondage upon that
and ſucceeding ages; and left a race of ſucceſſors
truly worthy of the inheritance of tyranny; a race
who were the ſcourge and ſhame of human nature,
the peits and butchers of the Romans, and of all men.
Such, literally, were the doings and character of
thy boaſted Cæſar, O Rome; theſe his atchieve-
ments, this his legacy! if all this make him not it
parricide, the higheſt parricide, the ineaning of words
is inverted, truth and reaſon have loſt their courſe,
and gilt and innocence are no more.
Did he not fill
thee, Rome, and all thy wide regions, with blood,
and woe, and chains ? he ſpoke well, he fought well;
but for whoſe fake? and who reaped the benefit ? was
not the benefit his; the expence, the pain, and for-
row, thine ? over thee and thy liberties was his laſt
triumph.
Rather boaſt a patriot; thy patriot Cato; one who
was a foe to thy foes, thy beſt champion, thy true pro-
phet: one who forewarned thee of all thy impending
calamities; ſtruggled to avert them; and periſhed ra-
ther than behold them. This is fame indeed ; ge-
nuine fame; great, immortal, and unallayed. What-
ever exploits Cæſar did, whatever fine qualities he
had, ſtill he enſlaved his country; a conſideration
that tarniſhes and fruſtrates all his praiſe.

Their books from wiſdom widely ſtray,.
Or point at beft the longeſt way.

Where wiſdom's furely taught below.
How deep yon azure dyes the ſky!
Where orbs of gold unnumber'd lie,
While through their ranks in filver pride
The nether creſcent ſeems to glide.
The flumb'ring breeze forgets to breathe,
The lake is ſmooth and clear beneath,
Where once again the ſpangled ſhow
Deſcends to meet our eyes below.
The grounds which on the right afpire,
In dimneſs from the view retire:
The left preſents a place of graves,
Whoſe wall the filent water laves.
That ſteeple guides thy doubtful fight
Among the livid gleams of night.
There paſs with melancholy state,
By all the folemn heaps of fate,
And think, as ſoftly fad you tread
Above the venerable dead,
Time was, like thee they life pofſeſt,
And time ſhall be, that thou ſhalt reit.

The marble tombs that riſe on high,
Whoſe dead in vaulted arches lie,
Whoſe pillars ſwell with ſculptur’d ſtones,
Arms, angels, epitaphs, and bones ;

OVELY, laſting peace of mind !
Heav'nly born, and bred on high,
To crown the fav’rites of the ſky
With more of happineſs below,
Than viĉors in a triumph know !
Whither, O whither art thou fled,
To lay thy meek contented head
What happy region doft thou pleaſe
To make the feat of calms and eife?
Ambition ſearches all its ſphere
Of

Increaſing avarice would find
Thy preſence in its gold inſhrin'd.
The bold advent'rer ploughs his way,
Through rocks amidſt the foaming ſea,
To gain thy love; and then perceives
'Thou wert not in the rocks and waves.

And feeks (as I have vainly done)
Amuſing thought; but learns to know
That folitude's the nurſe of woe.
No real happineſs is found
In trailing purple o'er the ground:
Or in a ſoul exalted high,
To range the circuit of the ſky,
Converſe with ſtars above, and know
All nature in its forms below;
The reſt it feeks, in ſeeking dies,
And doubts at laſt for knowledge riſe.
Lovely, laſting peace appear!
This world itſelf, if thou art here,

And man contains it in his breaſt.

Bid thy wild paſſions all be ſtill,
Know God and bring thy heart to know,
The joys which from religion flow:
Then ev'ry grace ſhall prove its gueſt,
And I'll be there to crown the reſt.
Oh! by yonder mofly feat,
In my hours of ſweet retreat ;

With ſenſe of gratitude and joj:

The Hermit. [By Dr. Parnell.]
F
I may affert eternal Providence,
And juſtify the ways of God to man. Milion.
AR in a wild, unknown to public view,
From youth to age a rev'rend hermit grew;
The moſs his bed, the cave his humble cell,
His food the fruits, his drink the chryſtal well :
Remote from man, with God he paſs’d the days,
Pray'r all his bus'neſs, all his pleaſure praiſe.
Á life fo ſacred, ſuch ferene repoſe,
Seem'd Heav'n itſelf, 'till one ſuggeſtion roſe;
That vice ſhould triumph, virtue vice obey,
This ſprung fone doubt of Providence's fway :
His hopes no more a certain proſpect boaſt,
And all the tenour of his ſoul is loft:
So when a ſmooth expanſe receives impreft
Calm nature's image on its watry breaſt,
Down bend the banks, the trees depending grow,
And Ikies beneath with anſw'ring colours glow :

But if a ſtone the gentle ſea divide,
S:wift ruffing circles curl on ev'ry fide,
And glimmering fragments of a broken fun,
Banks, trees, and ſkies, in thick diſorder run.
To clear this doubt, to know the world by fight,
To find if books, or fwains, report it right;
(For yet by ſwains alone the world he knew,
Whoſe feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew)
He quits his cell; the pilgrim-ſtaff he bore,
And fix'd the ſcallop in his hat before ;
Then with the fun a riſing journey went,
Sedate to think, and watching each event.
The morn was waſted in the pathlefs graſs,
And long and loneſome was the wild to paſs;
But when the ſouthern fun had warm’d the day,
A youth came poſting o'er a croſſing way;
His raiment decent, his complexion fair,
And ſoft in graceful ringlets way'd his hair.
Then near approaching, Father, hail ! he cry'd,
And hail, my Son, the rev'rend fire reply'd;
Words follow'd words, from queſtion anſwer flow'd,
And talk of various kind deceiv'd the road ;
'Till each with other pleas’d, and loth to part,
While in their age they differ, join in heart :
Thus ſtands an aged elm in ivy bound,
Thus youthful ivy claſps an elm around.
Now ſunk the fun; the cloſing hour of day.
Came onward, mantled o’er with fober grey;
Nature in ſilence bid the world repoſe :
When near the road a ſtately palace roſe :
There by the moon through ranks of trees they paſs,
Whoſe verdure crown'd their ſloping ſides of graſs.
It chanc'd the noble maſter of the dome,
Still inade his houſe the wand'ring ſtranger's home :
Yet ſtill the kindneſs, from a thirſt of praiſe,
Prov'd the vain flouriſh of expenſive eaſe.
The pair arrive: the liv'ry'd fervants wait ;
Their lord receives them at the pompous gate.
The table groans with coſtly piles of food,
And all is more than hoſpitably good.

Then led to reſt, the day's long toil they drown,
Deep funk in fleep, and filk, and heaps of down.
At length 'tis morn, and at the dawn of day,
Along the wide canals the zephyrs play ;
Freſh o'er the gay parterres the breezes creep,
And ſhake the neighb'ring wood to baniſh ſleep.
Up riſe the gueſts, obedient to the call :
An early banquet deck'd the ſplendid hall;
Rich luſcious wine a golden goblet grac'd,
Thich the kind maſter forc'd the gueſts to taſte.
Then pleas’d and thankful, from the porch they go ;
And, but the landlord, none had cauſe of woe :
His cup was vaniſh'd ; for in ſecret guiſe
The younger gueſt purloin'd the glitt'ring prize.
As one who ſpies a ſerpent in his way,
Gliftning and balking in the ſummer ray,
Diſorder'd ſtops to run the danger near,
Then walks with faintneſs on, and looks with fear:
So ſeein’d the fire ; when far upon the road,
The ſhining ſpoil his wily partner fhow'd.
He ſtopp'd with filence, walk'd with trembling heart,
And much he wiſh'd, but durſt not aſk to part:
Murm’ring he lifts his eyes, and thinks it hard,
'That gen'rous actions ineet a baſe reward.
While thus they paſs, the ſun his glory ſhrouds,
The changing ſkies hang out their fable clouds ;
A ſound in air preſag'd approaching rain,
And beaſts to covert ſcud acroſs the plain.
Warn'd by the figns, the wand'ring pair retreat,
To ſeek for ſhelter at a neighb’ring ſeat.
'Twas built with turrets, on a'riſing ground,
And ſtrong, and large, and unimprov'd around;
Its owner's temper, tim'rous and fevere,
Unkind and griping, caus’d a deſert there.
As near the miſer's heavy doors they drew,
Fierce riſing guſts with fudden fury blew;
The nimble lightning mix'd with ſhowers began,
And o'er their heads loud rolling thunder 'ran.
Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,
Driv’n by the wind, and batter'd by the rain:

At length ſome pity warm’d the maſter's breaſt,
('Twas then, his threſhold firſt receiv'd a gueſt)
Slow creaking turns the door with jealous care,
And half he welcomes in the ſhiv'ring pair ;
One frugal faggot lights the naked walls,
And nature's fervor through their limbs recalls :
Bread of the coarſeſt ſort, with eager wine,
(Each hardly granted) ſerv’d them both to dine;
And when the
tempeſt firſt appear’d to ceaſe,
A ready warning bid them part in peace.
With ſtill remark the pond'ring Hermit view'd,
In one ſo rich, a life ſo poor and rude;
And why ſhou'd ſuch, within himſelf he cry'd,
Lock the loſt wealth a thouſand want beſide ?
But what new marks of wonder ſoon took place,
In ev'ry ſettling feature of his face ;
When from his veſt the young companion bore
That cup, the gen'rous landlord own'd before,
And paid profuſely with the precious bowl
The ſtinted kindneſs of this churliſh ſoul.
But now the clouds in airy tumult fly,
The fun emerging opes an azure ſky;
A freſher green the ſmelling leaves diſplay,
And glitt'ring as they tremble, cheer the day :
The weather courts them from the poor retreat,
And the glad maſter bolts the wary gate.
While hence they walk, the pilgrim's boſom
wrought,
With all the travel of uncertain thought ;
His partner's acts without their cauſe appear,
'Twas there a vice, and ſeem'd a madneſs here:
Deteſting that, and pitying this he goes,
Loſt and confounded with the various ſhows.
Now night's dim ſhades again involve the ſky,
Again the wand'rers want a place to lye,
Again they ſearch, and find a lodging nigh.
The foil iimprov'd around, the manſion neat,
And neither poorly low, nor idly great :
It ſeem'd to ſpeak its maſter's turn of mind,
Content, and not for praiſe, but virtue kind.

Hither the walkers turn with weary feet,
Then bleſs the manſion, and the maſter greet:
Their greeting fair, beſtow'd with modeſt guife,
The courteous matter hears, and thus replies :
Without a vain, without a grudging heart,
To him who gives us all, I yield a part ;
From him you come, for him accept it here,
A frank and ſober, more than coſtly cheer.
He ſpoke, and bid the welcome table ſpread,
Then talk'd of virtue till the time of bed,
When the grave houſehold round his hall repair,
Warn’d by a bell, and cloſe the hours with pray’r.
At length the world, renew'd by calm repofe,
Was ſtrong for toil, the dappled morn aroſe;
Before the pilgrim's part, the younger crept,
Near the clos'd cradle where an infant ſlept,
And writh'd his neck: the landlord's little pride,
O ſtrange return! grew black, and gaſp’d, and dy'd.
Horror of horrors ! what! his only fon!
How look'd our Hermit when the fact was done?
Not hell, though hell's black jaws in ſunder part,
And breathe blue fire, cou'd more afiauit his heart.
Confus'd, and ſtruck with ſilence at the deed,
He flies, but trembling fails to fly with ſpeed.
His ſteps the youth purſues; the country lay
Perplex'd with roads, a fervant fhow'd the way:
A river croſs'd the path; the paffage o'er
Was nice to find; the fervant trode before ;
Long arms of oaks an open bridge fupply'd,
And deep the waves beneath the bend ng glide.
The youth, who leem'd to watch a time to lin,
Approach'd the careleſs guide, and thruſt him in;.
Plunging he falls, and riling lifts his head,
Then flaſhing turns, and finks anions
the dead.
Wild, ſparkling rage inflames the Hermit's eyes,
He burſts the bands of fear, and madly cries,
Deteſted wretch! but ſearce his ſpeech began,
When the ſtrange partner ſeem'd no longer man :
His youthful face grew more ſerenely ſweet;
His robe turn'd white, and flow'd upon his feet;

Fair rounds of radiant points inveft his hair;
Celeſtial odours breathe through purpled air ;
And wings, whoſe colours glitter'd on the day,
Wide at his back their gradual plumes diſplay.
The form ethereal burſts upon his fight,
And moves in all the majeſty of light.
Though loud at first the pilgrim's paſſion grew,
Sudden he gaz'd, and wiſt not what to do ;
Surpriſe in ſecret chains his words ſuſpends,
And in a calm his ſettling temper ends.
But filence here the beauteous angel broke,

In ſweet memorial riſe before the throne:

And force an angel down to calm thy mind;
For this commiſſion'd, I forſook the ſky,
Nay, ceaſe to kneel- -thy fellow-ſervant I.
Then know the truth of
goverment divine,
And let theſe ſcruples be no longer thine.
The Maker juſtly claims that world he made,
In this the right of Providence is laid;
Its facred majeſty through all depends
On uſing ſecond means to work his ends :
'Tis thus, withdrawn in ſtate from human eye,
The Pow'r exerts his attributes on high,

With him I left the cup, to teach his mind
That Heav'n can bleſs, if mortals will be kind.
Conſcious of wanting worth he views the bowl,
And feels compaſſion touch his grateful ſoul.
Thus artiſts melt the ſullen oar of lead,
With heaping coals of fire upon its head;
In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow,
And looſe from droſs, the ſilver runs below.
Long had our pious friend in virtue trod,
But now the child half-wean'd his heart from God;
(Child of his age) for him he liv'd in pain,
And meaſur'd back his ſteps to earth again.
To what exceffes had his dotage run?
But God, to ſave the father, took the ſon.
To all but thee, in fits he ſeem'd to go,

The

fond
parent, humbled in the duſt,
Now owns in tears the puniſhment was juſt.
But now had all his fortune felt a wrack,
Had that falſe ſervant ſped in ſafety back ;
This night his treaſur'd heaps he meant to ſteal,
And what a fund of charity would fail!
Thus Heav'n inſtructs thy mind: this trial o'er,
Depart in peace, refign, and fin no’more.
On founding pinions here the youth withdrew,
The fage ſtood wond'ring as the ſeraph flew.
Thus look'd Eliſha, when, to mount on high,
His maſter took the chariot of the ſky;
The fiery pomp aſcending, left the view;
The prophet gaz'd, and wiſh'd to follow too.
The bending Hermit here a pray’r begun,
Lord! as in heav'n, on earth thy will be done.
Then gladly turning, fought his ancient place,
And país’d a life of piety and peace.

For then you are ſafe, and may plead you're elect;
As it stands in the Acts we can prove ourſelves ſaints,
Being Chritt's little flock ev'ry where ſpoke againſt.
Said a jolly church parſon, devoted to eaſe,
While penal law dragons guard his golden fleece,
If you pity your ſoul, I pray liſten to neither;
The firſt is in error, the laſt a deceiver:
That ours is the true church, the ſenſe of our tribe is,
And ſurely in medio tutiffimus ibis.
Said a yea-and-nay friend with a ftiff hat and band,
Who while he talk'd gravely would hold forth his hand,
Dominion and wealth are the aim of all three,
Though about ways and means they may all difagree ;
Then pr’ythee be wiſe, go the Quakers' bye-way,
'Tis plain, without turnpikes, fo nothing to pay.

Like thy own folemn ſprings,
Thy ſprings and dying gales,
O nymph reſerv'd, while now the bright-hair'd fun
Sits in yon weſtern tent, whoſe cloudy ſkirts,
With brede ethereal wove,
O'erhang his wavy bed:
Now air is huth'd, fave where the weak-ey'd bat,
With ſhort ſhrill ſhrieks flits by on leathern wing,
Or where the beetle winds

As oft he riſes 'midſt the twilight path,
Againſt the pilgrim born in heedleſs hum:
Now teach me, maid compos’d,

Whoſe numbers ſtealing through thy darkning vale,
May not unſeemly with its ſtillneſs fuit,

Views wilds, and ſwelling floods,
And hamlets brown, and dim-diſcover'd ſpires,
And hears their fimple bell, and marks o'er all

The gradual dulky veil.
While ſpring thall pour his ſhow'rs, as oft he wont,
And bathe thy breathing trelles, meekeit Eve!
While ſummer loves to ſport
Beneath thy ling’ring light;
While fallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves ;
Or winter yelling through the troublous air,
Aftrights thy ſhrinking train,
And rudely rends thy robes ;

And hymn thy fav’rite name!

Beneath thoſe rugged elms, that yew-tree's ſhade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
The rude forefathers of the hamlet ſleep.
The breezy call of incenſe-breathing inorn,
The ſwallow twittering from the straw-built ſhed,
The cock's ſhrill clarion, or the echoing horn
No more ſhall rouſe them from their lowly bed.
For them no more the blazing hearth ſhall burn,
Or buſy houſewife ply her evening care :
No children run to liſp their fire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiſs to ſhare.
Oft did the harveſt to their fickle yield,
Their furrow oft the ſtubborn glebe has broke ;
How jocund did they drive their teem afield!
How bow'd the woods beneath their ſturdy ſtroke !
Let not ambition mock their uſeful toil,
Their homely joys and deſtiny obſcure;
Nor grandeur hear, with a diſdainful ſmile,

And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Await alike th' inevitable hour.

If mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raiſe,
Where through the long-drawn ille and fretted vault
The pealing anthem ſwells the note of praiſe.

Whilſt through the weſt, where finks the crimſon day,
Meek twilight flowly fails, and waves her banners grey ?

Is all, that meets the ſhepherd's ear,

Ah no, fair fancy rules the ſong :

She bids the waving aſpin-ſpray

She bids the fringed oſiers bow,
And ruſtle round the lake below.

But lead a moſt wrangling ſtrange fort of a life,
As great plagues to each other as huſband and wife.
The faule's all your own, who with flagrant oppreſſion,
Encroach ev'ry day on my lawful poffeffion.
The best room in my houſe
you have ſeiz'd for
your
own,
And turn'd the whole tenement quite upſide down,
While you hourly call in a diforderly crew
Of vagabond rogues, who have nothing to do
But to run in and out, hurry, ſcurry, and keep
Such a horrible uproar, I can't get to ſleep.
There's
my
kitchen ſometimes is as empty as found,
I call for my ſervants, not one's to be found :
They are all ſent out on your ladyſhip's errand,
- To fetch ſome more riotous gueſts in, I warrant!
And ſince things are growing, I fee, worſe and worſe,
I'm determin’d to force you to alter your courſe.
Poor Mind, who heard all with extreme moderation,
Thought it now time to ſpeak, and make her allegation.

The Shepherd and the Philoſopher.
A Fable. [By Mr. Gay.]
R
EMOTE from cities liv'd a ſwain,
Unvex'd with all the cares of gain,
His head was filver'd o'er with age,
And long experience made him fage.
In ſummer's heat and winter's cold
He fed his flock, and penn'd the fold;
His hours in cheerful labour flew,
Nor envy nor ambition knew;
His wiſdom, and his honeſt fame,
Through all the country rais'd his name.
A deep philofopher (whoſe rules
Of moral life were drawn from ſchools)
The ſhepherd's homely cottage ſought,
And thus explor'd his reach of thought.
Whence is thy learning? hath thy toil
O'er books conſum'd the midnight oil ?
Haſt thou old Greece and Rome ſurvey'd,
And the vaſt ſenſe of Plato weigh'd ?
Hath Socrates thy ſoul refin’d,
And halt thou fathom’d Tully's mind ?
Or, like the wiſe Ulyſſes, thrown
By various fates on realms unknown,
Haſt thou through many cities ſtray'd,
Their cuſtoms, laws, and manners weigh'd ?
The ſhepherd modeſtly reply'd,
I ne'er the paths of learning try'd,
Nor have I roam'd in foreign parts,
To read mankind, their laws and arts ;
For man is practis'd in diſguiſe,
He cheats the moſt diſcerning eyes :
Who by that ſearch ſhall wiſer grow,
When we ourſelves can never know?

Hence life's maxims took their riſe,
Hence grew my ſettled hate to vice.
The daily labours of the bee
Awake my ſoul to induſtry.
Who can obſerve the careful ant,
And not provide for future want?
My dog (the truſtieſt of his kind)
With gratitude inflames my mind:

In conſtancy, and nuptial love,
I learn my duty from the dove.
The hen, who from the chilly air
With pious wing protects her care,
And ev'ry fowl that flies at large
Inſtructs me in a parent's charge.
From nature too I take

To thun contempt and ridicule.
I never, with important air,
In converſation overbear;
Can grave, and formal, paſs for wife,
When men the folemn owl deſpiſe?

For who talks much muſt talk in vain :
We from the wordy torrent fly?
Who liſtens to the chatt'ring pye?
Nor would I, with felonious flight,
By ſtealth invade my neighbour's right,
Rapacious animals we hate :
Kites, hawks, and wolves deſerve their fate.

Thy fame is juſt, the fage replies,

Defy'd the man of art aloud.

By turns, this here, that there, convey'd ;
The cards, obedient to his words,

His little boxes change the grain,
Trick after trick deludes the train.

Baucis and Philemon. Imitated from the Eighth
Book of Ovid.
[By Dr. Swift. ]
IN
N ancient times, as ſtory tells,
The faints would often leave their cells,
And ſtrole about, but hide their quality,
To try good people's hoſpitality.
It happen'd on a winter night,
As authors of the legend write,
Two brother hermits, faints by trade,
Taking their tour in maſquerade,
Diſguis'd in tatter'd habits, went
To a ſmall village down in Kent,
Where, in the Itroller's canting ſtrain,
They begg'd from door to door in vain,
Try'd ev'ry tone might pity win;
But not a foul would let them in.
Our wand'ring faints in woful ſtate,
Treated at this ungodly rate,
Having through all the village paſs’d,
To a'finall cottage came at laſt;
Where dwelt a good old honeſt ye’ınan,
Call'd in the neighbourhood Philemon,
Who kindly did theſe faints invite
In his poor hut to paſs the night;
And then the hospitable fire
Bd Goody Baucis mend the fire;
While he froin out the chimney took
A fitch of bacon off the hook,
And freely from the fatteſt fide
Cut out large flices to be fry'd;
Then ſtepp'd aſide to fetch 'em drink,
Fillid a large jug up to the brink,
And ſaw it fairly twice go
round;

And often on each other gaz'd;
For both were frighten'd to the heart,
And juſt began to cry,—What ar't?
Then ſoftly turn'd aſide to view
Whether the lights were burning blue.
The gentle pilgrims ſoon aware on't,
Told them their calling, and their errant.
Good folks, you need not be afraid,
We are but ſaints, the hermits faid;
No hurt ſhall come to you or yours :
But for that pack of churliſh boors,
Not fit to live on Chriſtian ground,
They and their houſes Tall be drown'd;
Whilſt you ſhall ſee your cottage riſe,
And grow a church before your eyes.
They ſcarce had ſpoke, when fair and ſoft
The roof began to mount aloft ;
Aloft roſe ev'ry beam and rafter ;
The heavy wall climb'd ſlowly after.
The chimney widen'd, and grew higher,
Became a ſteeple with a fpire.
The kettle to the top was hoiſt,
And there food faſten’d to a joiſt,
But with the upſide down, to ſhow
Its inclination for below :
In vain; for a ſuperior force
Apply'd at bottoin ſtops its courſe :
Doom'd ever in ſuſpence to dwell,
'Tis now no kettle, but a bell.
A wooden jack, which had almoſt
Loft by diſule the art to roait,
A ſudden alteration feels,
Increas'd by now inteſtine wheels;
And what exalts the wonder more,
The number made the motion flow'r.
The flyer, though't had leaden feet,
Turn'd round ſo quick, you ſcarce could ſee't :
Eut, flacken’d by ſome ſecret pow'r,
Now hardly moves an inch an hour.

The jack would not be left alone ;

That roaſt meat, which it cannot turn.
The groaning chair began to crawl,
Like a huge ſnail, along the wall;
There ſtuck aloft in public view,
And, with ſmall change, a pulpit grew.
The porringers, that in a row
Hung high, and made a glitt'ring ſhow,
To a leſs noble ſubſtance chang'd,
Were now but leathern buckets rang’d.

Of Joan of France, and Engliſh Moll,

As thread-bare, and as full of duft.

To their Excellencies the Lords Juſtices of Ireland.
The humble Petition of Frances Harris,
Who muſt ſtarve and die a Maid, if it miſcarrios.
HUMBLY SHEWETH,
WHAT I went to warm myſelf in Lady Betty'sť
chamber, becauſe I was cold,
And I had in a purſe ſeven pound, four ſhillings, and
fixpence, beſides farthings, in money and gold:
So, becauſe I had been buying things for my lady
laſt night,
I was reſolv'd to tell my money, to ſee if it was right.
Now you muſt know, becauſe my trunk has a very.
bad lock,
Therefore all the money I have, which God knows
is a very ſmall ſtock,
I keep in my pocket, ty'd about my middle, next
to my ſmock.
So, when I went to put up my purſe, as God would
have it,
my
ſmock was unript,
And, inſtead of putting it into my pocket, down it
ſlipt :
Then the bell rung, and I went down to put my lady
to bed;
And, God knows, I thought my money was as ſafe
as my maidenhead.
So,

And ſtill continued by the laſt ?
Then, who with reaſon can pretend
That all effects of virtue end?

Believe me, Stella, when you ſhow
That true contempt for things below,
Nor prize your lite for other ends
Than merely to oblige your friends,
Your former actions claim their part,
And join to fortify your heart.
For virtue in her daily race,
Like Janus, bears a double face;
Looks back with joy where ſhe has gone,
And therefore goes with courage on.
She at your fickly couch will wait,
And guide you to a better ſtate.
O then, whatever Heav'n intends,
Take pity on your pitying friends!
Nor let

To fancy they can be unkind.
Me, furely me, you ought to ſpare,
Who gladly would your ſuff'rings ſhare ;

And think it far beneath your due;

Ere heaving bellows learn’d to blow,
While organs yet were mute,

At laſt divine Cecilia came,

The ſweet Enthuſiaſt, from her facred ſtore,
Enlarg'd the former narrow bounds,
And added length to folemn ſounds,
With Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.

ESCEND, ye nine! deſcend and fing;

Wake into voice each filent ſtring,
And fiveep the founding lyre!
In a fadly-pleaſing ſtrain
Let the warbling lute complain :
Let the loud trumpet found,
Till the roofs all around
The ſhrill echoes rebound :
While, in more lengthen’d notes and flow,
The deep, majeſtic, folemn organs blow.
Hark! the number ſoft and clear,
Gently ſteal upon the ear;
Now louder, and yet louder riſe,
And fill with ſpreading ſounds the ſkies ;
Exulting in triumph, now ſwell the bold notes,
In broken air trembling, the wild muſic floats ;
Till, by degrees, remote and ſmall,
The ſtrains decay,
And melt away
In a dying, dying fall.

By muſic, minds an equal temper know,
Nor ſwell too high, nor fink too low.
If in the breaſt tumultuous joys ariſe,
Muſic her foft, aſſuaſive voice applies ;
Or, when the ſoul is preſt with cares,
Exalts her in enlivening airs.
Warriors the fires with animated ſounds ;
Pours balm into the bleeding lover's wounds :

Muſic the fierceſt griefs can charm,
And fate's ſevereſt rage difarm :
Muſic can foften pain to eaſe,

And antedate the bliſs above.

And to her Maker's praiſe confin’d the ſound.
When the full organ joins the tuneful quire,
Th’immortal pow’rs incline their ear;

While ſolemn airs improve the ſacred fire;

And to the mercies of a moment leaves
The vaſt concerns of an eternal ſcene.
If not fo frequent, would not this be ſtrange ?
That 'tis fo frequent, this is ſtranger ſtill.
Of man's miraculous miſtakes, this bears
The palm, " That all men are about to live:"
For ever on the brink of being born.
All pay themſelves the compliment to think
They, one day, ſhall not drivel; and their pride
On this reverſion takes up ready praiſe ;
At leaſt their own; their future felves applauds ;
How excellent that life they ne'er will lead ?
Time lodg'd in their own hands is folly's vails :
That lodg'd in Fate's, to wiſdom they conlign:
The thing they can't but purpoſe, they poſtpone;
'Tis not in folly, not to ſcorn a fool;
And ſcarce in human wiſdom to do more.

And that through every ſtage; when young,

In full content, we ſometimes nobly reſt,
Unanxious for ourſelves; and only wiſh,
As duteous fons, our fathers were more wife.

At fifty chides his infamous delay,
Puſhes his prudent purpoſe to refolve ;
In all the magnanimity of thought
Rcfolves, and re-refolves: then dies the ſame.

WHY arriva
HY ſtart at death? where is he? Death
arriv'd
Is pait; not come, or gone, he's never here.
Ere hope, ſenſation fails ; black-boding man
Receives, not ſuffers death’s tremendous blow.
The knell, the ſhroud, the mattock and the grave;
The deep damp vault, the darkneſs and the worm,
Theſe are the bugbears of a winter's eve,
The terrors of the living, not the dead.
Imagination's fool, and error's wretch,
Man inakes a death, which nature never made ;
Then on the point of his own fancy falls;
And feels a thouſand deaths in fearing one.

Nor can Omnipotence reward the blow,
Be deaf; preſerve thy being ; diſobey.
Nor is it diſobedience: know, Lorenzo !
Whate'er th' Almighty's ſubſequent command,

All Winter drives along the darkened air :
In his own looſe-revolving fields the ſwain
Diſaſter'd ſtands ; ſees other hills aſcend,
Of unknown joyleſs brow; and other ſcenes,
Of horrid proſpect, ſhag the trackleſs plain ;
Nor finds the river, nor the foreſt, hid
Beneath the formleſs wild ; but wanders on
From hill to dale, ſtill more and more attray;
Impatient flouncing through the drifted heaps,
Stung with the thoughts of home; the thoughts of
home
Ruſh on his nerves, and call their vigour forth
In many a vain attempt. How finks his ſoul !
What black deſpair, what horror fills his heart!
When for the dulky ſpot, which fancy feign'd
His tufted cottage riſing through the ſnow,
He meets the roughneſs of the middle waste,
Far from the tract and bleſt abode of man;
While round him night refiftleſs clofes faſt,
And every tempeft, howling o'er his head,
Rendere the favage wilderneſs more wild ;
Then throng the buſy ſhapes into his mind,
Of cover'd pits, unfathomably deep

Of faithleſs bogs; of precipices huge,

Where the freſh fountain from the bottom boils.

Mix'd with the tender anguiſh nature ſhoots
Through the wrung bofom of the dying man,

In glided Marg'ret's grimly ghoit,
And ſtood at William's feet.
Her face was like the April-morn,
Clad in a wintry cloud ;
And clay-cold was her lilly-hand,
That held the table ſhroud,
So Mall the faireft face appear,
When youth and years are flown ;
Such is the robe that kings muſt wear,
When death has reft their crowu.
Her bloom was like the ſpringing flow'r
That ſips the filver dew;
The roſe was budded in her cheek,
And opening to the view.
But love had, like the canker-worm,
Conſum'd her early prime :
The roſe grew pale, and left her cheek ;
She dy'd before her time.
Awake, the cry'd, thy true love calls,
Come from her midnight grave,
Now let thy pity hear the maid,
Thy love refus'd to ſave.
This is the dark and fearful hour,
When injur'd ghoſts complain ;
Now dreary graves give up their dead,
To haunt the faithleſs ſwain.

And give me back my troth.

How could you promiſe love to me,
And not that promiſe keep?
Why did you ſwear mine eyes were bright,
Yet leave thoſe eyes to weep?
How could you ſay my lip was ſweet,
And made the ſcarlet pale ?
And why did I, young witleſs maid,
Believe the flate'ring tale?
That face, alas ! no more is fair,
That lip no longer red;
Dark are mine eyes, now clos’d in death,
And ev'ry charm is filed.
The hungry worm my ſiſter is ;
This winding-ſheet I wear;
And cold and weary laſts our night,
'Till that laſt morn appear.
But hark! the cock has warn'd me hence :
A long and laſt adieu!
Come ſee, falſe man, how low ſhe lies,
That dy'd for love of you.
Now birds did fing, and morning ſmile,
And ſhew her glittering head;

Where Ivarg'rer's body lay,
And itretch'd him on the green graſs turf,
That wrapt her breathleſs clay.
And thrice he call'd on Marg'ret's name,
And thrice he wept full fore;
Then laid his cheek to the cold earth,
And word ſpake never more.
A Hymn of Gratitude.
[By Mr. Addiſon.]
THEN all thy mercies, O my God,
My riſing foul ſurveys ;
Traniported with the view I'm loft
In wonder, love, and praiſe !
O how ſhall words with equal warmth
The gratitude declare,
That glows within my raviſh'd heart !
But thou can't read it there.
Thy providence my life fuſtain'd,
And all my wants redrett,
When in the filent womb I lay,
And hung upon the breaſt.
To all my weak complaints and cries
Thy mercy lent an ear,
Ere yet my feeble thoughts had learnt
To form themſelves in pray’r.
Unnumber'd comforts to my
foul
Thy tender care beſtow'd,
Before
my
infant heart conceiv'd
From whom thoſe comforts flow'd.

When in the flipp’ry paths of youth
With heedleis ſteps I ran,
Thine arm unſeen convey'd me ſafe
And led me up to man;
Through hidden dangers, toils, and deaths,
It gently clear’d my way:
And through the pleaſing Inares of vice,
More to be fear'd than they.
When worn with ſickneſs oft haſt thou
With health renew'd my face,
And when in fins and ſorrow funk,
Reviv'd my foul with grace.
Thy bounteous hand with worldly bliſs
Has made my cup run o'er,
And in a kind and faithful friend
Has doubled all my ſtore.
Ten thouſand thouſand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ,
Nor is the leaſt a cheerful heart
That tiftes thoſe gifts with joy.
Through every period of my life
Thy goodneſs I'll purſue;
And after death in diſtant worlds
The glorious theme renew.
When nature fails, and day and night
Divide thy works no more,
My ever-grateful heart, O Lord,
Thy mercy ſhall adore.
Through all eternity to thee
A joyful fong I'll raiſe,
For oh! eternity's too ſhort
To utter all thy praiſe.

To know but this, that thou art good,
And that myſelf am blind.
Yet gave me, in this dark eſtate,
To ſee the good from ill ;
And binding nature'faſt in fate,
Left free the human will.
What conſcience dictates to be done,
Or warns me not to do,
This, teach me more than hell to ſhun,
That, more than Heav'n purſue.
What bleſſings thy free bounty gives,
Let me not caſt away ;
For God is paid when man receives,
T'enjoy is to obey.
Yet not to earth's contracted ſpan
Thy goodneſs let me bound,
Or think thee Lord alone of man,
When thouſand worlds are round.
Let not this weak unknowing hand
Preſume thy bolts to throw,
And dea amnation round the land,
On each I judge thy foe.

If I am right, Oh teach my heart
Still in the right to ſtay ;
If I am wrong, thy grace impart
To find the better way.
Save me alike from fooliſh pride,
Or impious diſcontent;
At ought thy wiſdom has deny'd,
Or ought thy goodneſs lent..
Teach me to feel another's woe,
To hide the fault I fee;

Mean though I am, not wholly fo,
Since quicken'd by thy breath :
O lead me whereſoe'er I go,
Through this day's life or death.
This day be bread and peace my lot;
All elſe beneath the ſun
Thou know'ſt if beſt beſtow'd or not,
And let thy will be done.
To thee, whoſe temple is all ſpace,
Whoſe altar, earth, ſea, ſkies,
One chorus, let all Being raiſe !
All Nature's incenfe riſe!
